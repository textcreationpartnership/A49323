            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Chriſtian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis following Tract was prepared to be a Refutation of Dr. <hi>Lewis du Moulin's Reflections upon the Number of the Elect,</hi> long before his Death. But you may ſee no haſte hath been made to impart it to the World, having been (too long I confeſs) retarded in expectation of ſome other more able Pen, which could have convinced him of his Error.</p>
            <p>Yet ſince it hath pleaſed God to put an end to his Days, and that no man hath hitherto (ſo far as I can learn) appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Vindication of the Truth of the Goſpel againſt him in this particular, I have accounted it my Duty to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, in regard I have already been an Aggreſſor upon him, in the Antidote which I gave the World about a year paſt, to keep poor deſponding ſinners from receiving harm by his uncharitable Opinion of the ſmall number of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>He hath, It ſeems, Repented him, before he died, of all thoſe perſonal Reflections which he made in his Books on the Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as that they leaned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Popery, and in down-right terms that they had made ſeveral Advances towards <hi>Rome;</hi> But as for this Book of his Reflections upon the Number of the Elect, I find no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation of it made by him at all, or by any elſe for him; And do therefore fear that he left the World with this Opinion
<pb facs="tcp:61822:3"/>which he had ſo deeply imbibed upon his Soul without any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Repentance of it.</p>
            <p>Whereupon he having been ſuch a leading man among thoſe that pretend to know more of the mind of God in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than others, it is much to be doubted, he will have many Diſciples to follow him, who will <hi>Jurare in verba Magiſtri,</hi> take all to be Goſpel which he hath written of this Subject: For ſeeing there are many of them (as it is ſaid) who ſtill perſiſt in their Invectives, and have ſince his death publiſhed under his name <hi>an Additional Account of the Church of</hi> Englands <hi>Advance towards Popery</hi> (though it appears clearly by many Infallible Proofs to be as falſe a Slander, as the Father of Lies himſelf could Invent) what can be otherwiſe imagined, but that ſuch bluſt'ring Zealots will much more ſecond him in this Antifundamental Opinion? Such people being prone to publiſh that Doctrine, which ſeems to Canonize them for the few that ſhall be ſaved, and to damn to Hell all thoſe, whoever they be, that ſhall but look awry upon them, out of a diſlike of their Fraternity, and their Opinions.</p>
            <p>Upon which Account I would that this which is here written againſt the ſaid Doctor may be conſtrued as directed unto them, to prevent their precipitant Zeal in following his Example by mealing with the number of Gods Elect. For him, I hope God hath forgiven him his Error therein: And ſeeing that he lived to wiſh that his Soul might be with theirs whom he had in his life-time (according to his own confeſſion) wronged in his uncharitable Cenſures, I believe he hath found before this time a real Demonſtration of his Error in numb'ring thoſe that came not within the compaſs of his Arithmetick.</p>
            <p>I do therefore leave him in his Bed of Reſt, but ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al warn all men by this which is here written againſt him, to take heed that they run not after him into ſuch want of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which he lamented on his Death-bed as being Inconſiſtent with the power of Godlineſs and true Chriſtianity. Yea I would adviſe thoſe that profeſs themſelves to be his Diſciples, ſeriouſly to conſider with their own Souls betimes whether their defam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:61822:3"/>the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as this Doctor had done, or their raſh determining of the number of Gods Elect, like unto him be ſuch as he would have approved on his Death bed, or (as it hath been already ſaid) ſuch as they will dare to Anſwer for at the great day before Gods Tribunal.</p>
            <p>But if any will yet be ſo Anti-Evangelical as to appear in the defence of his deſperate Doctrine of a general Damnation, and their defence be managed by them with Learning, Piety and Moderation in the Judgment of thoſe that are wiſe and godly, with whom I hold a Converſation, I ſhall though I be ſuperannuated (as being in the ſeventy ſeventh year of my Age) certainly maintain the truth of the Goſpel in that point a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Humbly beſeeching God to give us all a right Underſtanding more and more in the Myſtery of the Goſpel; And if in the publication of this my labour of Zeal I have offended either in the manner or matter of it, the good Lord, I hope, will pardon me, ſeeing I had prepared my heart only to aim at his Glory, though I have not done it exactly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rule that is ſet me.</p>
            <p>Having thus far given my Apology for publiſhing this Tract; It is meet that ſomewhat be alſo here premiſed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Doctor, to the end my Readers may diſcern how unfit he was to enter upon ſuch a Controverſie. He was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous it ſeems (having been publick Profeſſor of Hiſtory in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi>) to appear to the World as an <hi>Atlas</hi> in that kind of Learning, by quoting ſeveral of the Antient Fathers, and other Writers; that he might thereby add ſome ſtrength to his Opinion: But the truth is, he did rather in ſo doing lay open his weakneſs to the pre-judging of his own Cauſe: As may be made evident by two of his Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherein he failed, and it is therefore to be ſuſpected, he hath done the like in many more. The two Quotations which I have ſingled are theſe that follow.</p>
            <p>In the thirteenth Page of his Book, where he undertook to prove that the greateſt part of the World was in the ſtate of Damnation, and muſt inevitably ſink in it, it is thus written.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:61822:4"/>
            <p>The Popes drew all <hi>Europe</hi> into Perdition; And this is what all the World would ſuffer,<note place="margin">Per Docilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Aſininam.</note> unleſs ſome or other were permitted to Reſiſt the Pope and to demand of him, By what Authority he led ſo many Millions of Perſons into Hell: For it is that which we learn from the Canon, <hi>Si Papa, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which <hi>Et-Caetera</hi> ſignifies that this Doctor was of that Opinion in which others before him have been deceived: For it to is moſt ſhamefully falſe which is alledged from the ſaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, <hi>viz.</hi> that the purport of it is this, Albeit the Pope ſhould drive the whole world into Hell, no man ought to ſay unto him, why do you ſo?</p>
            <p>But before I proceed any further herein, let no man here ſo far miſtake me, as if I were pleading for Popery. It is only to lay open the plain truth in this caſe without Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is doubtleſs faulty enough, yea moſt abominable in her Doctrines and Doings, yet will it not become us to make it worſe than in truth it is; She hath Guilt enough upon her that will certainly in Gods due time bring her down wonderfully, ſo that the World ſhall ſay, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon the Great is fallen, is fallen.</hi> But that the aforeſaid Opinion of her is a great untruth, and conſequently that the Doctors Collections from thence were vain, ſhall be here made manifeſt from that which is paſt all Contradiction.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> The Author of the ſaid Canon was not a Pope, as it hath been Imagined; But it was St. <hi>Boniface</hi> a faithful Martyr of Jeſus Chriſt (as in the Title of the ſaid Canon is expreſſed) which <hi>Boniface</hi> was never Pope but a Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Learned Engliſhman who lived about nine hundred years paſt, and was the firſt Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> of which People and Countrey he is called the Apoſtle (by antient Writers) for that he publickly converted the Nation, Erected that Primate See, and ſuffered glorious Martyrdom by the Heathen for the Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> The Canon, <hi>Si Papa, &amp;c.</hi> was taken by <hi>Gratian</hi> out of the Writings of that St. <hi>Boniface.</hi> The Introduction
<pb facs="tcp:61822:4"/>into which Canon is, according to the words of that Holy Man, in this manner. <hi>Damnatur Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licus qui ſuae &amp; Fraternae Salutis eſt negligens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plagismultis in aeternum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulaturus.</note> The Pope is damned who is negligent in the Affairs of his own Salvation, and of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; after which beginneth the Canon, <hi>Si Papa ſuae &amp; Fraternae Salutis negligens, &amp;c.</hi> Shewing that albeit the Pope have no Superior Judge in this World, which may by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity check him, unleſs he fall into Hereſie: Yet ſhall his Damnation be greater, than of other ſinners, for that by Reaſon of his high Dignity he draweth more after him into Perdition than any other.</p>
            <p>Whereby we may perceive that this Canon was written not to flatter the Pope, but to warn him rather of his Peril, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But how then came the World to miſtake this Canon, as if it ſaid, though the Pope ſhould carry many people with him into Hell, yet no mortal Creature may preſume to ſay unto him, why do you ſo?</p>
            <p>To give a ſhort Anſwer to this demand; I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the ſtory at large, and make mention of the names of thoſe Perſons engaged in a Contract about this Canon, which occaſioned thoſe hard words clean differing from the Intent and Scope of it, and which did put ſome upon a more ſtrict Inquiry into it; The Reſult whereof is briefly this, ſome of the words of the ſaid Canon were miſ-placed, ſome omitted, and ſome miſquoted. The omiſſion of that which is in the Canon is this, <hi>Cum ipſo plagis multis in aeternum vapulaturus,</hi> that ſuch a Pope is to ſuffer eternal Puniſhments, and to be ſcourged with many Stripes together with the Devil himſelf, if by his evil and negligent Life he be the cauſe of others Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Threat being omitted, theſe words, as immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately following in the Canon, are miſplaced and joyned with the Antecedent words which ſhould have been put after, <hi>viz. Hujus culpas redarguere Praeſumit nemo, &amp;c.</hi> That which is miſ-quoted is <hi>Praeſumet</hi> for <hi>Praeſumit,</hi> no man ſhall or may preſume, for, no man doth preſume to Control. Laſtly,
<pb facs="tcp:61822:5"/>That which followeth containing a Reaſon of all that went before, is left out, <hi>viz. Quia cunctos ipſe judicaturus a nemine eſt judicandus, niſi deprehendatur a fide devius, &amp;c.</hi> For that whereas he is the Judge of all other men, he cannot himſelf be judged by any except he be found to err from the true Faith.</p>
            <p>Here is the caſe in as few words as it could poſſibly be put, which clearly ſhew the ſiniſter Senſe that hath been put upon that Canon, yet this it was certainly which led the Doctor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Error; For, ſaith he, it is that which we learn from the Canon, <hi>Si Papa, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond miſtake is in that he quoteth St. <hi>Auſtin Lib. 1. de verâ &amp; falsâ Poenitentia, Cap. 5.</hi> Affirming that he hath there an excellent Thought (as his uſual word is) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if he meaneth by <hi>Lib. 1.</hi> the firſt Book (as probably that muſt be the meaning) this muſt go into the miſtakes, for there is but one Book of that Subject <hi>de verâ &amp; falſa Poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia:</hi> Neither is that one any of St. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> Work; But it is thruſt in by others as an <hi>Appendix</hi> only to St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin;</hi> yea more, the Author of that Book (whoever he was) produceth a Sentence out of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> expreſly naming him, <hi>Cap. 17.</hi> to which ſaying of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> the ſaid Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth to give his Conſent which is a clear Argument, it is not St. <hi>Auſtin's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But inſtead of this miſ-quotation I could wiſh that the Doctor had thorowly peruſed that Book <hi>de verâ &amp; falſâ Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiâ,</hi> for he would have found in that Book a full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of his Opinion concerning a general Damnation, and that which I have written in my Antidote to be as fully confirmed.</p>
            <p>Moreover beſides theſe Miſtakes, the ſaid Doctor, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the dreadful Clamour made of <hi>Millions of Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ſhall periſh in their ſins,</hi> addeth that which may well be accounted in Effect a plain Contradiction to his Opinion, by ſhewing what is the concurrent Judgment of ſome Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Divines in this Caſe, whom he nameth, calling them
<pb facs="tcp:61822:5"/>
               <hi>The true Barnabaſſes,</hi> and to whom he ſubſcribes his Conſents <hi>viz.</hi> That the Juſtice of Gods Tribunal at the laſt day is full as much laid open in the Pardon of the greateſt ſinners that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, as it is in the Vengeance and Puniſhment, of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, and thoſe that know not God, That when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come in the laſt times, he will do the ſame to thoſe that truly have Repented, though even at the laſt Period of their Lives, That the Mercies ſhewen to <hi>Zacheus</hi> and the Thief upon the Croſs were particular and perſonal, but the Comfort which is to be received from thence, is common and publick. Adding likewiſe further in the ſame Page,<note place="margin">Pag. 39.</note> that the ſame Engliſh Divines do alſo agree with all the Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In one conſiderable mark of a Child of God, and which (as he ſaith) is comprehenſive all Divinity and the practiſe of Piety, and which may alſo be ſhut up in one Period, to wit, that notwithſtanding the Atheiſm whether Speculative or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical, ſecret or open that Reigns at this day in the World, and all the Difficulties which are met with in the Interpretation of the Holy Scriptures, which Human Reaſon cannot unravel and underſtand, a man ought to be ſtrongly and powerfully perſwaded of the Truth, Goodneſs and Excellency of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of this holy Scripture which contains it; And that it will be his Eternal Happineſs, if it be now his principal Care, Study and Endeavour to obey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereto may be joyned what one of his ſaid Engliſh Divines affirmeth <hi>(Pag. 24.) viz.</hi> That Gods Mercies are offered to us in ſuch a manner, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is required of us but that we would Accept them without any thoughts of our own ſo much unworthineſs to hinder and keep us from it: that as his Promiſes are of Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſo likewiſe are they Rich and Great. That in truth, they are made to thoſe that believe, but alſo that Faith is a Gift of God, and he gives it as liberally, as he grants the pardon of ſins.</p>
            <p>And who is there that will not now be ready to ſay, if all this be ſo, to what purpoſe is all this heat and fury in ſo bold, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable condemning the major part of mankind to Hell-fire?
<pb facs="tcp:61822:6"/>Do not theſe words of his Engliſh Divines, (ſome of whom (as <hi>Owen, Baxter,</hi>) were as Oracles unto him) ſpeak aloud to the World that the Doctor might well have ſaved himſelf the labour of writing his <hi>Reflections upon the Number of Gods Elect?</hi> For they do plainly prove his <hi>Thouſands, Hundred Thouſands, Millions, Millions of Millions</hi> that ſhall be damned to be Inſignificant Cyphers, as to Gods ſecret Purpoſe and Decree, and likewiſe as to his Will revealed in Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>One thing, I conſeſs, there is which he writeth of theſe Divines, (but hath been here omitted) which I for my part can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but except againſt, that is, that they have mingled with all theſe Lenitives ſuch a Corroſion as may in ſome ſin ſick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients prove for ever deſtructive to their precious Souls, <hi>viz.</hi> that the greatneſs of Repentance ought to be commenſurate to the Greatneſs and Enormity of the ſins that have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>What warrant thoſe men, or any elſe, can have for this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is beyond my reach. I confeſs ſomewhat may be ſaid for it from Reaſon, if we conſider what paſſeth between us poor Creatures when we are offended each with other, it is but ſit that the Quality of the Repair or Acknowledgment ſhould be apportioned according to the Quality of the Offence, but doth God require the ſame of us for our Violation of his Law as if ſatisfaction ſhould be given to his Juſtice by our Repentance.</p>
            <p>True it is, very good it would be in us all, if we did walk humbly with our God all the days of our Lives, according to the Hainouſneſs of our Iniquities, as <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> did, when he had ſinned greatly againſt God, he humbled himſelf greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the God of his Fathers, and when <hi>Peter had ſinned ſo wickedly in denying his Maſter, he went forth and wept bitterly.</hi> But is this the constant method, as this Doctor hath ſaid, which God hath preſcribed in the Converſion of greateſt ſinners? What would then become of thoſe that repent only <hi>in Articulo mortis,</hi> when they are at the point of death? Yea what alas will become of us all, if this were required of us? It is not hanging down our heads like Bul-Ruſhes, nor beating
<pb facs="tcp:61822:6"/>our Breaſts, nor ſhedding our Tears, though in abundance that will come near to a ſatisfaction for our Tranſgreſſions; not but that where true Repentance is in the Heart, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as the right word is, and natural ſtrength is waiting upon it, theſe external Humiliations will be, yea and in ſome meaſure ought to be: But to make ſuch account of them, or to truſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as if we had obliged God by them ſo as to have mercy upon us, and that he could not in Juſtice deny us now the pardon of our ſins (which is the old Pelagian Error, and new Popery down-right) this will really prove an Aggravation of our ſins, and make them exceeding ſinful.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe hear what Mr. <hi>Bilney</hi> a faithful Martyr of Chriſt in the Reign of <hi>Hen. 8th.</hi> once ſaid of ſuch kind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as this is, if (ſaith he) I had heard ſuch Preaching of Repentance in times paſt, I ſhould utterly have fallen into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation. And in his writing to Dr. <hi>Tonſtall</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> he hath theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſpeak of one of your famous Men; After he had ſharply inveighed againſt Vice (wherein he did well, for it cannot be too much abhorred) he thus concluded, behold, ſaid he, <hi>thou haſt lien rotten in thine own Luſts,</hi> it may be by the ſpace of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years, even as a Beast in his own Dung, and wilt thou preſume in one year to go forward toward Heaven, and that in thine Age, as much as thou wenteſt backward from Heaven to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Hell in threeſcore years? Is not this think you (ſaith that good Martyr) a goodly Argument? is this the Preaching of Repentance in the Name of Jeſus? Or rather is it not to tread down Chriſt with Anti-Chriſt<hi>'s</hi> Doctrine? For what other thing did he ſpeak in effect than that Chriſt died in vain for poor ſinners? He will not (it ſeems by this Preaching) be our Jeſus or Saviour, but we muſt make ſatisfaction for our ſelves by our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, elſe we ſhall periſh eternally. Then doth St. <hi>John</hi> lye (quoth he) in ſaying, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſin of the World;</hi> And in another place, <hi>His Blood cleanſeth us from all our ſins,</hi> and again, <hi>He is the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole World,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:61822:7"/>Thus he, like one that well underſtood the Myſtery of the Goſpel, and good it were, if we did ſo all of us, that pretend to be Preachers of truth in this Generation.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered, let not ſo high an eſteem be ſet upon that Doctor, as to Account him infallible, for it is certain, he was deceived, and he himſelf did find it ſo before he died, as appeareth by his own confeſſion on his Death-bed. I am loth to ſay what hath been written to me of him by a Neighbour-Miniſter (who for his Learning and Piety is wortly of a due Regard) as that he (the ſaid Dr. <hi>Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>) had ſome private ends and hints, and that he had been prompted to this ill Office upon thoſe Accounts. But this I will affirm conſtantly, if after all this friendly warning that hath been given to thoſe that tenaciouſly ſtick to his Opinions now ſince his Deceaſe, and will publickly Advance after him (a word that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed) in his Errors, ſo making them worſe at the laſt than they were at the beginning, I ſay no more, but <hi>Oculus ad finem, the coming of the Lord draweth near, when every mans work ſhall be made manifeſt, whether it be Wood, Hay, Stubble, or that which is precious, and will endure the ſearching fire of Gods Spirit, which will one day try every mans work of what ſort it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſeeing that ſundry Errors as well of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as of other falſe Brethren have crept in among us, I have here produced ſeveral Arguments againſt that unreaſonable Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and tho' I kno' many learned Authors have written already, in the Vindication of the Doctrine of our Church againſt that of <hi>Rome,</hi> Inſomuch that it may be thought what is here done, is but <hi>actum agere,</hi> to repeat only the Arguments that have been formerly uſed; Yet this I will be bold to aſſirm, that that old ſaying, <hi>nihil erit dictum quod non dictum fuit prius,</hi> cannot here be objected againſt me. True, it is impoſſible but we muſt ſometimes take up the ſame Weapons to encounter our Enemies which others have before uſed, yet may they be ſharp'ned and furbiſh'd afreſh, that an inſipid <hi>Crambe,</hi> ſhall not in the uſing them be here laid to my charge, nor dull the edge of them. Yea and a new Weapon ſhall be here taken out of the Armory of holy Scripture, that never was (ſo far as I can find) managed before by any, which may prove as convincing <hi>(abſit arrogantia)</hi> as any other.</p>
            <p>The deſign of which little Tract is, according to the Title that is ſet before it, to lay open the Falſhood and Abſurdity of that grand Error, of Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been a long time ſo infatuated as to wreſt the words of our Saviour which he ſpake of the Bread at his laſt Supper, <hi>(viz. This is my Body)</hi> to make them ſpeak that which be never intended, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little or not at all medling with his other words concerning the Cup, as well knowing the very reciting of them, would be a ſufficient Conviction of their Error; I ſhall therefore here deal with them at their own weapon, and to that purpoſe will, at the very entrance, call upon my Reader, to remember the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which he ſpake at his laſt Supper, <hi>viz. This is my Body.</hi>

            <head>DU MOULIN'S Reflections REVERBERATED.</head>
            <p>THE Deſign of this Treatiſe is to put a ſtop to the Carieer of one Mounſieur <hi>Moulin,</hi> (I ſay not that Reverend Dr. <hi>Peter Moulin,</hi> Who is, As he well deſerveth an Eminent Dignitary among us, but his unworthy Brother <hi>Lewis</hi>) who like <hi>Jehu</hi> marcheth furiouſly here in our Nation out of his Road, venting his Paradoxes not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Order and Diſcipline eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> But againſt the very Doctrine of the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which ſhould be dearer to us than our Lives.</p>
            <p>It is Reported by ſome that he is a Schollar, and poſſibly they may have taken his Dimenſions in that kind from his Office that he held by the Title of Uſurpation in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the late Schiſm; But doubtleſs his Pamphlet Entituled <hi>Moral Reflections upon the number of the Elect,</hi> was not Penued at <hi>Athens.</hi> Sure I am, It did not ſpring from the ſweet Fountain of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for whatſoever his Learning may otherwiſe be, he hath not yet learned Chriſt ſufficiently to know the Truth, as it is in <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Character hath been given me of him in <hi>ſcriptis</hi> from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> by a very good hand which is as it here followeth. <q>This <hi>Lewis Du-Moulin</hi> is by Profeſſion a <hi>Civilian,</hi> by perſwaſion an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant, a man of a Moroſe and inſolent Converſation, he was a Hiſtory-Profeſſor at <hi>Oxford</hi> in the times of the late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Diſtractions. But being thrown out of his Desk at the happy Return of our Peace, he is led away by a miſguided
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61822:8"/>Zeal, turns Malecontent, Peeviſh and Froward; quarrelling with all good Order and Diſcipline, thinking himſelf not enough out of <hi>Babylon</hi> unleſs he be out of himſelf; A man that ought to be ſeverely corrected for his Inſolence and Folly, it being to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Magiſtrate would take ſuch Men under their Diſcipline, which will work a more effectual Cure upon them, than the moſt Satyrical Pen, though dipt in Gall, as wiſe Generals puniſh mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous Perſons more than Thieves and Robbers. The Reaſon (ſaith my Friend) that makes me more ſevere with him is, becauſe he hath, ſince I writ to you laſt ſet forth another Diſcourſe under this Title, <hi>viz. The Conformity of Diſcipline and Government among thoſe who are commonly called Independants to that of the Antient Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians.</hi> You may gueſs of the Book by the Title: It is not worth your Animadverſion, nor my time to give you any Rehearſal of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Man with whom we have here to deal about his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reflections upon the number of the Elect</hi> (ſo he calls them) and as the man is, ſo is his Work, wherein he advanceth (as his bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Tranſition is) on and on, without any Order or Method, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that whoſoever he be that ſhall undertake him ſhall have but as 'twere a Rope of Sand to hold by in following his Track: On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it muſt be the Pages of his Book that are to be my Conduct, and the Exerciſe of my Readers Patience, if he will give himſelf the trouble to peruſe them.</p>
            <p>Which Book of his, though I had it in my cuſtody before I writ my Preface to the Antidote being then at the Preſs (for I would not anſwer a matter until I hear it or know it, That (as a wiſer man than either he or I are ever like to be, hath ſaid) would be Folly and Shame unto me) yet have I for born hitherto to anſwer it particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, becauſe I hoped ſome other would have Reverberated this Reflector according to his Deſert before this time: And well might it have been expected, ſeeing his hand hath been ſo buſie againſt every Man, not above one in a million eſcaping the Virulency of his Pen, I ſuppoſed every Mans ſhould be againſt him. But ſince it is ſo that no man hath hitherto appeared in this Contract, but my ſelf, albeit ſeveral Perſons both Wiſe and Godly have approved of that which I have already done in it, I ſhall now proceed further to make his Folly manifeſt to all men, hoping that I may thereby do ſomewhat in the ſervice of my Maſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> for the Glory of his great Name. The good Lord give his Bleſſing unto it, that the good People of God may be confirmed in the Truth of the Goſpel, and that this Unevangelical Doctor may have ſome ſight
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61822:8"/>of his Folly alſo, who now ſits Brooding upon his Error. And againſt whom I confeſs I have a zealous Indignation, fearing Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in this caſe may be imputed as a ſin unto me.</p>
            <p>Firſt then to begin with the Title of his Book, he calleth it <hi>Moral Reflections upon the number of the Elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>[Moral Reflections]</hi> Would any man that had Learning, Fear of God in him, Chriſtian Love or good Manners towards the Church of God have Reflected ſo boldly upon the ſecret Counſels of the Almighty, as this peremptory Mounſieur hath done, by uſing this Term of <hi>Reflection</hi> in this caſe? I know the word hath of late ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Paſs, and gone for current inſtead of Obſervations, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it is ſo <hi>toto Coelo</hi> Excentrick, as we ſay, from God that it cannot be uſed in the Senſe it is here put to, without Blaſphemy; Not therefore to be paſſed by without a Reflection, or a Repercuſſion rather. To Reflect, what is it but to Bend or Bow, or ſtrike again?<note place="margin">Flectere ſi nequeam, &amp;c.</note> And though our Rhetorick may ſometimes lead us to this word in things of a meer human Alloy, yet I think I may ſafely ſay no ſober modeſt Author, Chriſtian, Jewiſh or Heathen did ever ſtretch it to ſuch a height, as this proud Dictator doth, in giving a final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon things Divine that are ſecret to us. And that which leads me to this conſidence is, becauſe <hi>Cicero</hi> that Prince of human Learning (if we may give any heed to a large and perfect <hi>Index</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the four Tomes of his Works) did never ſo uſe it.</p>
            <p>Let this Mounſieur then talk what he will of the Worth and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Subject, his Divinity (certainly) is very ſlender, that he dares thus raſhly more than ever any Man did preſume to make Reflections upon Gods Infinite Wiſdom, in determining Gods eternal Election according to his Phanſie, which is above the reach of Men and Angels.</p>
            <p>Nor will his Word <hi>Moral</hi> wherewith he would Poliſh his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſome Reflections make them acceptable, rather it makes them ſeem more ugly. Will any man think that his blunt, muddy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals can either Penetrate or Illuſtrate that inacceſſible Light which no man hath ſeen, or can ſee? or can he imagine that his Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will excuſe his Blaſphemy? It is ſomewhat I confeſs, that he did not name the Elect here Gods Elect (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth often in his Epiſtles) though he cannot deny but that that muſt be his meaning. Yet (poſſibly) being conſcious to himſelf that he had been already too bold with God, he durſt not for ſhame advance ſo far, as to call them Gods Elect.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61822:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Nevertheleſs taking his words as they are rendred by him (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently enough) hath he known the mind of the Lord? or hath he been his Counſellor? To know the number of Gods Elect with a Reference to the number of thoſe that are left to Periſh in their Sins? I could name a man, of whom this Puiſny may learn, one that had heard the Words of God (which may be called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) and knew the knowledge of the moſt High, which paſſeth Knowledge, and who ſaw the Viſion of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, yet made it a Queſtion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.10.</note> 
               <hi>Who can count the Duſt of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and the number of the fourth part of</hi> Iſrael? Which he meant it's like, of the Elect of God, as his following words ſeem to imply. But out of all doubt God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Abraham Gen</hi> 22. <hi>That his Seed ſhould be as the Stars of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and as the Sand which is upon the Sea-ſhore innumerable,</hi> ſhewing him how to make his Account from things above, and from things beneath, which might probably ſignifie both Jews and Gentiles, for he was to be the Father of many Nations (which muſt alſo be underſtood in a ſpiritual Senſe) what reckoning then can any man make of thoſe that are without number? But to be medling thus with Gods numbring, it is ſuch a Boldneſs that is without Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel.</p>
            <p>Holy <hi>David</hi> would have taught him more Modeſty when ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Salvations (<hi>P.</hi> 71.15.) he ſaith, <hi>Non cognovi nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros ejus,</hi> confeſſing he knew not his numbers, <hi>q. d.</hi> He had no skill in that kind of Arithmetick, ſuch Knowledge was too wonderful for him, it is high, he could not reach it. St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> Renders it <hi>non cognovi Negotiationes ejus,</hi> meaning that he (the Prophet) knew not the ſeveral ways of Gods dealing out his Salvations to the Children of men, the Negotiations of his Grace and Mercy with the Souls of poor Sinners to bring them to Heaven, he thought were not only ſecret but numberleſs. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> thus, <hi>Non cogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi Literatunam ejus,</hi> he knew not a Letter in Gods Book of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts wherein the number of the Elected is Enrolled, meaning, The Book of Life was far above his Reading; yet this poor Illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Man, it ſeems knew all, ſo that he could tell, as if he had taken out a Copy of the Account how many were to be ſet at the laſt Day on the Judges right hand, and how many on his left. Otherwiſe he would not have ſaid his Reflections are proved plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Scripture: Which proof if he can produce (for in all that he hath yet written there is no ſuch Evidence) I ſhall hereafter be willing (as old as I am) to go to his School and learn to caſt up my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61822:9"/>Accounts better than I have done, though I believe a man may learn better of the Soothſayer before mentioned.</p>
            <p>Three places of Scripture I know there are, but no more upon which he will faſten, to prove his numbring right, all which are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved in my Antidote againſt him, to be heterogeneous from the <hi>Propoſitum</hi> in hand. What a Doctor then have we here that hath ſet forth a Book pretending that his Reflections therein are proved plainly by Scripture-Evidence, when they have no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from thence at all? And ſeeing that the ſpirit of God hath not given his <hi>Imprimatur</hi> unto it, the audacious Author well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth to be ſmitten with that Exprobration written <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Haſt thou not ſeen a vain Viſion? And haſt thou not ſpoken a lying Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination? Whereas thou ſayeſt, the Lord ſaith it, albeit God hath not ſpoken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is it that he ſaith is proved ſo plainly from Scripture-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? Why, that not above one in a hundred thouſand, nay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably not above one in a million from <hi>Adam</hi> down to our Times ſhall be ſaved. See how punctual this French Calculator is in his Accounts: Surely a man would think our times were much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to him, that we are not brought into the ſame Condemnation with thoſe before us: But let us not be too haſty to catch at his Charity, nor to fear his Fury. At his firſt onſet (to ſpeak of his Fury) he is like a true Frenchman very fierce, but he doth but hide his Tallons, for he will, we ſhall ſee, open them again, and gripe us to death everlaſting as much as others.</p>
            <p>And what is the Reaſon think ye, that he doth ſo curtal his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death here in his Title, which he after enlargeth even to the day of Judgment? Poſſibly this Mounſieur may be of their mind, who held that there were no more of Mankind to be ſaved, than might ſuffice to ſill up the vacant places in Heaven, from which the Angels who kept not their firſt Eſtate, but left their own Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, fell down to Hell: or it may be he is ſomewhat near of kin to the antient Gnoſticks, who were of opinion that none were ſaved, but all went to Hell, till the fifteenth year of <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> wherein it was from Heaven Revealed, <hi>This is my Beloved Son, Hear him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man might here indulge himſelf with too much Mirth, but it is better in this caſe to be ſerious. That which did put him upon this ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pring and mincing his number in the Title Page, which in his Book he uttereth with open mouth, was it may be his fear of diſpleaſing his own party, leſt they might ſuppoſe he had a hard opinion alſo of them for the major part of them, or poſſible he donbted he ſhould exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61822:10"/>the whole World about him, if he had in his title extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his uncharitable Cenſure to the full length, and that thereupon his Book might <hi>primâ facie</hi> have been caſt aſide with a <hi>quis legit haec? Nemo, hercule nemo,</hi> or have vaniſhed like a <hi>Cacodaemon</hi> or <hi>Spectrum</hi> quite out of ſight, or into Grocers Shops for waſt paper, as it hath been ſaid of another like unto it <hi>in Thuris, piperiſve cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, never was there man that wrote at the rate, as this man hath written. How great a Scandal (alas) hath he brought upon the Chriſtian Profeſſion? For ſhould this be received without a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Contradiction, as a Doctrine of Truth among us, <hi>viz. That not above one in a Million ſhall be ſaved,</hi> our Religion would be the moſt uncomfortable Religion of any in the World, and who among thoſe that are Aliens from it, will ever be perſwaded to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts unto it?</p>
            <p>Nay then may Satan well inſult, and with triumphant Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings cry out with a ſhout, <hi>O Chriſt, where is thy Victory; what, is the Blood of God, ſpent for the Salvation of the world, become of ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle value that ſo ſmall inconſiderable number can be ſaved by it?

               </gap>, and I know not what, but a poor Prince, and a weak Captain haſt thou proved thy ſelf to be, when I like a Stout and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Champion indeed have brought the greateſt number of thoſe, for whoſe ſake thou didſt enter the field againſt me, under my Command, not above one in a million but ſhall for ever be ſubject unto me, and conſequently never to be delivered from everlaſting Deſtruction. <hi>Horrendum dictu!</hi> Never, O dear Chriſtians, never let our Souls enter into the ſecrets of this man, nor be Baptiſed with the Baptiſm that he is Baptiſed with.</p>
            <p>Somewhat we may diſcern by him of the miſerable Fruits, which the late Schiſm and Rebellion brought forth amongſt us, that ſuch as he ſhould be preferred then to a place of Dignity in one of our Univerſities, where he might be the more able <hi>cum privilegio,</hi> to do miſcheif by his whimſical Opinions. However I am glad it is not any of our Nation that hath run into this worſt kind of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm, but one that hath been an Intruder amongſt us.</p>
            <p>While men ſlept in thoſe days the Enemy, we ſee, hath been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to ſow his Tares, yet may theſe Tares be now plucked up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hurt to the good Corn, yea very much would it be to the advantage of it, if they were quite removed. And therefore ſince this Intruder hath diſobliged our Nation, yea goeth on ſtill to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige it more and more, it were to be wiſhed that he had his Paſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61822:10"/>given him to return again to his own Countrey with ſhame, for there is no reaſon he ſhould ſtay longer to eat of our Bread or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in our Nation, as he hath by his own Confeſſion upwards of fifty years, and yet be ſo unworthy of this Privilege by his diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from us both in the Doctrine and Diſcipline of our Church, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby Troubles to us while we are here in this World, and ſending us all for the moſt part packing to Holl, when we depart out of it.</p>
            <p>At leaſt I could wiſh that his Works may have the ſame Law put in force upon them, as the Works and Wares of Aliens are to have by the Statute of the 14th. and 15. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8th. <hi>viz.</hi> that ſpecial Marks be ſet upon them, to prevent the Fraud and other worſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences that may ariſe unto us by them.</p>
            <p>I have done with his Title, upon which I confeſs I have inſiſted too long, but that what hath been here written of it, may be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that which hereafter followeth in the Refutation of this uncharitable mans abſurd Opinion.</p>
            <p>Before I come to his Book there are alſo ſome parts of his Epiſtle to be Reflected upon and to be Reverberated too for that Religious Perſons ſake to whom he Dedicates his Book, and for the ſake of all others who may have the hard hap, as I have had, to Read it.</p>
            <p>Firſt I find no fault with Dedicating his Book to an Honourable Lady, one that excelleth in Piety, knowledge of and Love to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Things (as his words are) whom if he had called his Elect La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it had been pertinent to his purpoſe, for (ſurely) he could not but account her as one choſen out of his millions <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let ſuch Perſons, whom the King delighteth to honour, have all that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour given them which is their due, and when by their exemplary Piety they bring a more than ordinary Luſtre upon Religion, God himſelf hath promiſed to honour them likewiſe: Well then may we that are Miniſters of the Goſpel by all good ways and means en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour without flattery to do the ſame. This man (I do not call him Miniſter of the Goſpel for that it ſeems he is not) but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he be, he hath ſo done by his Dedication, and I commend him for it. It is pity he did not ſet her name unto it as well as her Title. She is a ſtranger unto me, one of whom I never before heard, though I have made ſome inquiry of Perſons about me.</p>
            <p>But though I commend him in his deſign of Dedicating, I cannot approve of all that he hath written in it. He humbly <hi>begs to have leave to lay his Treatiſe at her Honours Feet for Protection,</hi> this me-thinks ſounds not well, and ſignifies a fear in him (as well there
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61822:11"/>might) that he failed in his undertaking. Why elſe doth he thus fall a begging? when if his Treatiſe be (as it ſhould be) according to Truth, he needs no ſuch protection of it, for no doubt God would protect him in it, and the whole Church of God would ſtand by him againſt me and all others that ſhould except againſt it. But if otherwiſe it agree not with the Standard of Truth, that is, the holy word of God, who will not ſay neither he nor it deſerves any Protection at all, what then is the matter, trow? that he ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begs Protection? Doth the man fear he ſhall be knockt on the head that he thus ſeeks for Protection? or will his Treatiſe be ſafer at her Honours Feet, than it would be upon a Stationers Stall? The feet indeed is the ſitteſt place for it, that is, to be trodden up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſpurned into the fire rather than to be protected, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do much hurt to thoſe that ſhall read it or hear it.</p>
            <p>Had he Dedicated his Book to his good Brother, or to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that may be better able than himſelf to diſcern the diſhonour which he doth to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his Goſpel by it, he might not have poſſibly been in danger thereupon to have fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the number of thoſe Millions whom he ſo much condemns; which I fear, without a ſerious Reflection upon himſelf and his Works, ſuch as may through Grace lead him to Repentance for it, he will find to be his Portion in the end to his ſmart and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Non obſtante</hi> (as I have ſaid already) I diſlike not his Zeal in <hi>awakening the World out of that ſluggiſh Lethargy to which all,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>are more or leſs inclined;</hi> Let the Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Sinai</hi> be ratled in the Ears, and darted into the Eyes of ſecure impenitent ſinners, let the Terrors of the Law be as <hi>Magor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſabib, formido circumquaque,</hi> dreadful to them round about, let the Judgment to come be diſplayed before them with all the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Appearances of it. This indeed being according to the form of found words which the Spirit of God in Scripture hath ſet us in our Preaching, may do ſome good, as it hath done to many deſperate ſinners in opening their Eyes, and turning them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God. But it is a falſe Allarm that this man ſoundeth to that purpoſe when he tells the World that not above one in a hundred thouſand, nay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably not above one in a Million ſhall be ſaved. This is not to be as a Schoolmaſter to drive us to Chriſt, but rather as a Devil to ſcare us from him. This is the Eccho rather of the Bottomleſs Pit, the Reverberation that ariſeth from the deep Caverns of Hell, enough to make men run headlong into Deſparation, or into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſm,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61822:11"/>or at leaſt into Epicuriſm and greater Diſſoluteneſs in their Lives; Neither indeed can any other be expected, when the mercies of God, which have always been proclaimed to be infinite, are ſo ſtraitned,<note place="margin">

            <p>A good Doctrine would this be where that Antichriſtian Tenet is received as an Evangelical Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that men ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by their own Righteouſneſs, and ſaved by their own Works, for then well may it be ſaid, not one in a Million, nay not one in all the World from <hi>Adam</hi> down to the laſt man that ſhall ſpring from that ſinful Root ſhall ever be ſaved, well may the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now ſing their <hi>Jo Paean,</hi> and well may the Quakers that fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Sect joyn in it, For this man hath done all their work for them.</p>
            <p>But to go on with his Dedication. He is (it ſeems by his words) at the end of his Stage, even as I am, I confeſs, at the end of mine, and it will concern us both therefore to be very wary how we get off from it. No neceſſity (though) was there for him before his <hi>Exit</hi> to gaze about for a <hi>Plaudite</hi> by proclaiming publickly that it is the common Entertainment he allows himſelf to meditate upon his Leaving the Stage. Let him on Gods name employ his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (if he have any) in conſidering his latter end, and his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance before the great God, and God Almighty grant that I alſo may do the like. Nevertheleſs when I look upon his Boldneſs in reflecting upon Gods <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> I am afraid he is not ſo wiſe as he ſhould be in that matter of his Departure, but that either the thought of his latter end was then the latter end of his thought, or if his thoughts did run to the end of his Stage, his precipitant Phanſie did ſo out-run them, that he could hardly reach with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the end of his Race. And as for others, better ſurely were it for us, who are ready to be unclothed (as the Apoſtle's word is) <hi>to reflect upon our ſelves by a ſerious Examination of our Hearts, Lives and Opinions, then to be Aſtoniſhed with the Stupidity and profound Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of others,</hi> which I confeſs is much to be lamented too where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is. But for him to boaſt thus of himſelf, and at the ſame time to condemn the groſs of Mankind (as he impudently calls it) for their Negligence in that matter, wherein he would have us believe he himſelf excelleth, what is this but Phariſaiſm in a high degree.</p>
            <p>All their thoughts and buſtle (he ſaith) amount only to this to purſue the Luſts of the Fleſh, the Luſts of the Eye, and the Pride
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61822:12"/>of Life, and to advance their carnal Intereſts in the World, as if there were nothing more to hope for or to fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies not only to Heathens, but to thoſe that are born in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World, that are Educated and Bred up in the Truths of the Goſpel, in whom he ſaith this Inſenſibleneſs is inexcuſeable.</p>
            <p>See I beſeech (good Readers) what a <hi>Cenſor morum</hi> this doughty Doctor is and how Arrogant, in that he will dare to uſurp a divine Power thus by entring into the Hearts of men, and to know all their Thoughts; What knoweth he but that a great multitude of thoſe whom he accounts inſenſible may have as great a ſenſe of ſin at ſome time or other in their Souls and ſorrow for it, as he himſelf hath? Yea and though they make not ſo great a buſtle in the World about it as he doth, yet may their ſorrow be more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a godly ſort. For him, when I hear what carefulneſs there is in him to amend his Errors, what Apology he can make for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf about them, what Indignation he hath againſt his own Heart for conceiving them, when I hear of theſe and the other effects of godly ſorrow to be in him, I will rejoyce and praiſe God for the Grace that is given him, but till then I muſt ſay he hath exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſinned againſt God, and let him be ſure his ſin will find him out.</p>
            <p>In the mean while when he ſaith all their thoughts and buſtle amount only to this, to purſue the Luſts of the Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to advance their carnal Intereſts in this World, as if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to hope for, or to fear: On the other ſide the Gulph which all muſt ſhoot, I would know of him what he means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, would he have men to neglect their Callings whereto God hath called them, and wherein, by the Apoſtles Rule, they are to abide with God, otherwiſe not to eat? Men that are wiſe would ſay, the more Noiſe and Buſtle men make in the World by their Diligence and Induſtry in their Callings, the more are they to be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, provided that they keep themſelves within due Bounds, eſpecially that they neglect not the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num neceſſarium,</hi> the one thing needful: For whereas God commands us to ſerve him, he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us alſo to ſerve our ſelves, nay more, by ſerving our ſelves in a holy conſcientious Uſe of Gods Bleſſings, and by following our Callings in Obedience to his Commands, God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts himſelf to be ſerved too.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 3.24.</note> Servants (ſaith St. <hi>Pauly in ſerving their Maſters diligently, ſerve the Lord Chriſt, they wrought for me, ſaith the Lord</hi> (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.20.) when it was their own Intereſts and Advantages they aimed at in their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle which they made. If then this be the buſtle which he means,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61822:12"/>God will certainly in mercy pay wages for it, notwithſtanding the buſtling of this fooliſh man.</p>
            <p>Or would he have men caſt off their near and dear Relations ſo as to take no care for them contrary to the will of God often revealed in Scripture? This were a buſtle indeed that would overthrow all natural Affection, and make men worſe than brute Creatures. One of theſe I gueſs he doth mean by his writing at this uncharitable rate, more like a Judge than one that ſhall be judged among other men.</p>
            <p>Let him examine all the Examples of Holy Men, whoſe Praiſe is upon Record in the Book of God, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, David, &amp;c.</hi> Were they not all diligent in their particular Callings? Were they not all tenderly affected towards their natural Relations, Wives and Children? Yet no man will ſay that their care of their own eternal Salvation was leſſ'ned thereby; And if the groſs of mankind (as he like a proud Phariſee calls the major part of the World of men) do the ſame now as thoſe Patriarchs and other holy Men did, with what face can he ſay that all their Thoughts and Buſtle amount only to this, to purſue the Luſts of the Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to advance their carnal Intereſts in this World, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Rather doth not an Anabaptiſtical Spirit haunt and purſue this man, which hath put him upon theſe Whymſies to account all that is done by men in the World but a vain Buſtle, unleſs it be (forſooth) licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſod by his magiſterial <hi>Fiat?</hi> No Prince (if at leaſt he will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any) ſhall go to War againſt an encroaching and enraged E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, but he will call it a Buſtle, no Merchant ſhall Traffick with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Forreign Nation, but it ſhall be a Buſtle, no Tradeſman tend his Shop without a Buſtle, no Artificer practice his Scill, but it is a Buſtle, no ſhepherd look after the ſtate of his Flocks without a Buſtle, no Ruſtick Till his Ground, ſow his Corn, gather in his Harveſt, carry it to Market, but it muſt be a Buſtle, no Husband take care for the things of this World how he may pleaſe his Wife, nor no Wiſe take care for the things of this World how ſhe may pleaſe her Husband, but all this muſt be a buſtling to purſue the Luſts of the Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to advance carnal Intereſts in this World. How this Buſtler can be able to ſtand with confidence before men in this World, when he hath been thus pragmatical in ſtretching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his Laſt, I know not, and how he will able to ſtand in the Judgment at the laſt Day, let him look to it betimes before it be too late.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid before we ſhould go on with his Dedication, but I doubt I go too far, making the Porch too big for the Building that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61822:13"/>is to follow one Reflection therefore and no more ſhall be here made upon ſome other words in his Epiſtle Dedicatory.</p>
            <p>You ſay indeed that there are ſome Divines very ſincere and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are apt to believe that the Mercies of God are of a vaſt Extent, far beyond our poſſibility of finding out. And why apt to believe? as if they did not yet really believe this; Surely if they be good Divines inſtructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven, they do fully believe that the Mercies of God (I will not ſay as you ſay, are of a vaſt Extent, that's a word too much below the Height of this Divine Subject, but they do believe they) are infinite, and that the Dimenſions thereof are incomprehenſible, far beyond (as you ſay) our poſſibility of finding out: This queſtionleſs they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and do not you (Sir) believe ſo too? If you do not (which your words imply) you are ſo far from being a Sincere and Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Chriſtian, that intruth you are no Chriſtian at all, but a down-right Enemy to God and his Son Jeſus Chriſt: If you do believe it, why do you caſt off thoſe ſincere Divines ſo ſleightly by ſaying There are ſome others whoſe Reaſons appear more ſtrong and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newy to you, and who alledge Scripture for their Opinion, that conclude the Mercy of God is to be reſtrained, to a fewer num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>[The Mercy of God] was there ever man that dallyed thus with the glorious Attribute of God? He ſpake before of the Mercies of God, as of many wherein he did well, for they are indeed without number: But now being about to make Gods Mercies of a leſs Extent, the Plurality thereof would not agree ſo well with his Fancy, therefore he ſpeaks of them now in a diminutive Senſe: Whereas had he written like a Schollar, he would have made the Correſpondency in the latter Branch exactly according to the former and have called them, as they are, the Mercies of God, nor did he before make mention of any number to whom the Mercies of God ſhould have been extended, only now the ſmall number which ran in his mind hath made him to vary his words, and to bring them down to Nonſenſe.</p>
            <p>Having ſtayed thus long in the Portal, it is now time to enter into the Building, where inſtead of Mercy being built up, as the good Pſalmiſt foretold it ſhould, and that for ever, we ſhall find it miſerably broken down, which will be but a cold Entertainment for my Reader who hath his hope in Gods mercy, only he ſhall ſee it here repaired in ſome meaſure, and the Ruines of it, removed out of his ſight, that his hope in it may be ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yet more and more.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:61822:13"/>
            <p>The Reflector begins here again with his Title of <hi>Moral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections</hi> upon the number of the Elect, as if he were not aſhamed of it, but would ſtand to it like a Valiant Man, whereas it will appear his Boldneſs is but dawbed over with Impudency, nor will his ſhuffling excuſe his Impudence by telling the world what others ſay of this unmerciful Tenet; For that which they ſay, and they ſay as he writes, pretending as if he himſelf had nothing to ſay to it, he affirms it to be his own Judgment in the following parts of his Diſcourſe, ſurpaſſing all that ever I heard of, or I think any man elſe in uncharitable judging, declaring his mind plainly that not above one in a Million ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he begins with the opinions of others that differ from him, giving his ſenſe of them, naming one <hi>Caelius Secundus Curio,</hi> an Author, I confeſs, that I am not acquainted with, whoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, though he diſlikes it, is moſt Orthodox, and is the ſame which I ſhall here maintain againſt this Reflector, and againſt the World, <hi>viz.</hi> That the number of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved is, in all probability, much greater than the number of thoſe that ſhall be Damned.</p>
            <p>But as for that of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> whom he nameth alſo, if that be true which he writeth of him, <hi>viz.</hi> that the number of the Saved and the Damned is equal, juſt as many of the one, as of the other,<note place="margin">Zuinglius.</note> which he and his followers would prove by certain Parabolical Alluſions and Semblances that are not Argumentative, I ſhall let it paſs, as unworthy of any Regard.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Arguments of the firſt ſort, <hi>viz. Caelius, &amp;c.</hi> that are moſt pertinent to the matter in hand, though this Reflector takes no notice of them or but very little, I ſhall briefly recollect and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Account of them; Firſt,</p>
            <p>The Law in its greateſt Rigor ſays that God puniſheth but to the third and fourth Generation, but he ſheweth Mercy to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Generations, Thus they.</p>
            <p>And will not you Mr. Reflector ſay ſo too? If you will not, you muſt fall under the Curſe threatned by the Holy Ghoſt <hi>(Rev. 22.) viz. God will take your Part out of the Book of Life, i.e.</hi> Caſt you out of his Church, ſo that you ſhall be uncapable of any of the Bleſſings belonging to it: If you will ſay thus, the Thouſands to whom God will ſhew Mercy would have ſounded better under your Pen, than that which you have writ of the number of thoſe that ſhall be Damned.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but inſert what a learned and good Divine
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61822:14"/>hath writ to me when he ſaw my Antidote againſt your Book. we (ſaith he) ſeldom or never (in ſacred Pages) meet with the terrifying number of the Damned particularly ſummed up, but of the Happy we find <hi>Rev. 7.</hi> ſuch preciſe numbers mentioned. And ſome thouſands of years before that, it is written <hi>God had Mercy in ſtore for thouſands of them that loved him and kept his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, in truth, is the Spirit that hath prevailed among us here in this our Church, it being well known that the <hi>Genius</hi> (if I may ſo call it) of our Nation hath always more inclined to Mercy than to Rigor, and hath been apt to interpret the Law of God as well as the Law of our Land rather for the Comfort and Benefit of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, where ſuch a Conſtruction may upon good terms be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then for their Ruine and Deſtruction. I know not (Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur) what hath been predominant with you in other parts of the World. But it is you and ſuch as you are that have joyned with the Roman Faction againſt us to create Diſturbances among us, and to lead captive ſilly People into many abſurd Errors which have brought a Cloud over all our Excellency, and have eclipſed that glory of Truth and Peace, which but for you would, long ere this time, have dwelt in our Land.</p>
            <p>You go on to tell us what they ſay <hi>(viz. Caelius, &amp;c.)</hi> That the Mercies of God are of a large Extent, that God is ſlow to Anger. ready to Pardon and ſhew Mercy, that he forgives ſins of the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Dye, and that <hi>Calvin</hi> remarking upon the words which God ſpeaks (<hi>Ex.</hi> 34.) <hi>of his forgiving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin</hi> that God thereby wonderfully advances the greatneſs of his own Mercies, and that he would have us to know, he Pardons not only little Sins, but alſo the moſt Enormous, and that God would not command us to ſay Forgive us our ſins, if he had not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to forgive them; for he did not make that Command to ſend us away from him (as you impiouſly ſay) like Fools as we came. Yet is your Sarcaſme an Argument againſt you.</p>
            <p>All which that they ſay of this matter, and much more that you add is true, and which all good People who believe there is a God, will ſay. How dare you then to contradict it by ſaying, not above one in a Million ſhall ever by theſe Infinite Mercies come to Heaven? Would any man but you having all theſe Comfortable Promiſes of Mercy and Overtures of Grace under your Eye, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude expreſly for the Execution of Gods Wrath to the uttermoſt upon his poor Creatures that have ſinned againſt him?</p>
            <p>But that you after ſay, the Arguments for your Opinion are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61822:14"/>more ſtrong and nervous (how ſtrong they are we ſhall ſee hereafter.)</p>
            <p>In the mean time I muſt tell you, theſe Premiſes (though you ſlight them as being not Syncategorical with your Poſition) yet are they certainly againſt you, and make for the Truth.</p>
            <p>You ſay further that they mightily Preſs, (As all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans will) the Infinite Price and Value of the Merit, Death and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Redemption of Jeſus Chriſt, which is not only ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious to Pardon (you ſhould rather have ſaid to obtain Pardon for) an Infinity (that's your word) of ſins both for their number, and their Enormity, but alſo for an Infinity of men. That it is extreamly to leſſen the ends, for which Jeſus Chriſt came into the World, to admit, that he came only to Redeem one man of a Million. That it is not to be believed that Jeſus Chriſt at the right hand of his Father does intercede but for one of a hundred thouſand of all mankind. What you ſay to all this, we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
            <p>They do likewiſe (ſay you) mightily urge this Conſideration that ſince none are in a State of Damnation, but who are under a perpetual <hi>weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth,</hi> and an eternal Horror of Conſcience for their paſt Offences, it cannot rationally be affirmed of ſo many millions of Heathen Children that dyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to the uſe and exerciſe of Reaſon: And if God be merciful to theſe (as who can determine the contrary) it would be ridiculous (ſuch is your word, as if you had a mind to laugh at God) that God has reſerved their Parents alive, who have the uſe of Reaſon, to damn them to all eternity; what you will ſay to all this alſo would be conſidered, for none of all theſe things move you.</p>
            <p>Moreover who will believe (ſay they) that God ſo loved the World, or that he ſent his Son into the World, not to condemn it, but that it might be ſaved by him, <hi>That Chriſt is the Lamb of God that takes away the Sin of the World, and that he being the Bread of Life, gave himſelf to the World to give Life to it, &amp;c.</hi> who will believe that by the World, we muſt underſtand but one or two Perſons among I know not how many thouſands or millions in the World? And where is that love towards the World, to let it walk, that is to ſay periſh in its own ways?</p>
            <p>All this and much more is alledged by that Orthodox Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Party againſt your deſtructive Opinion, as for that other which makes the number equal between the Elect and Reprobate, as I have ſaid, I meddle not with it. And you Mr. Reflector had
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61822:15"/>done better if you had made no mention of it at all: For to what purpoſe do you recite it, and their Arguments for it, when you may know it is not at this time of any Account, ſcarce a word ſpoken of it among any, unleſs it be with Contempt? But you were willing to muſter up your Enemies, and drive them before you altogether promiſcuouſly like a brave man at Arms, or rather like that <hi>Pugnaciſſimum Animal,</hi> as it is ſaid of the Gander, <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta elidere Manu,</hi> to cruſh them altogether, as it were with one gripe.</p>
            <p>Two and twenty of their Forces you have reckoned up Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphically with words at length and with figures too, enough to make your Valour famous in conquering them. And what is it that you do againſt ſuch a Troop? It is methinks ſomewhat like to that which the man did againſt the learned Cardinal with two words only quite confuting him, <hi>viz. Mentiris Bellarmine.</hi> So ſay you here, but for all this, I like better thoſe that are on my ſide, than thoſe that are againſt me.</p>
            <p>So that in effect it is your own poor narrow Soul that muſt ſway the Ballance againſt all the Reaſon that can be produced, and againſt all the Whimſies too of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>If this be not childiſh and abſurd, what is? Children, we know, are wont to ſay, but for all that, I will do what I liſt; or as Scolds ſay, for all this, I will have it as I pleaſe. The word, it's true, hath been uſed in ſome Caſes to good purpoſe, but never by Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in their Diſputations, eſpecially when Arguments have been multiplied againſt them.</p>
            <p>You come at length to ſhew what your Party can do in your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but do it not. They do you ſay moſt eaſily enervate and weaken all the Arguments of thoſe who hold the opinion of <hi>Caelius Curio Secundus, i. e.</hi> That the major part of mankind ſhall be ſaved; And how do they ſo?</p>
            <p>They ſay firſt, if we ought not to be too ingenious to throw men into a Deſpair of their Salvation, ſo we ought not to lull them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in the depth of ſecurity by a falſe Perſwaſion that they ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Firſt I muſt here tell you it is not your word, they ſay, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe your Nonſenſe, and what is it that they ſay which you do not ſay? But would any man undertake ſuch a weighty Matter as this is and manage it no better? That which you offer in the firſt place ſhould be (as your vaunting words are) moſt ſtrong and nervous; But how is it ſo, when it fails both in Senſe and Reaſon? We
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61822:15"/>ought not, you ſay, to be too ingenious to throw men into De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and you ought to be ſo ingenuous now to acknowledge your Folly, when it is made known unto you. For tell me ſadly, do you account it a Trick of Wit to caſt men into Deſpair of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? I ſhall not charge this upon you (though your word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies ſo much) no nor will you (I believe) nor will any of your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pretend unto it, what a ſtout Champion then are you to begin thus with Nonſenſe? You will ſay poſſibly, it is but a Typographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Eſlip, the word here ſhould be Ingenuous, but the Printer here failed, yet neither will this help you, for what ingenuity or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Nature can there be to do the Devils Work? you ſhould have ſaid If we ought not to be too ſevere in that kind, this will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily granted you; for doubtleſs it is the moſt uncomfortable Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the World to offend in ſuch a Severity, and moſt impious. But by ſhunning ſuch a Severity we ought not you ſay to lull men aſleep by a falſe perſwaſion that they ſhall be ſaved. And what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is here; Is there any neceſſity that he that ſhunneth the one muſt unavoidably do the other? Thus far I will conſent unto you in this Caſe, whoſoever he be that ſhall do his endeavour to lull men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in the depth of Security by a falſe perſwaſion that they ſhall be ſaved, he is in danger himſelf of Eternal Damnation.</p>
            <p>But you make your Argument here to be like unto that which hath been called by Logicians <hi>Argumentum Crocodilinum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">a Dilemma.</note> for as the Crocodile if you follow him will lead you into his Den, <hi>i. e.</hi> into the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> if you fly from him, he will purſue you, till he have faſtned upon you, ſo do you, if we conſent unto your Doctrine, you will lead us into a damnable Snare, where we ſhall be in danger to make men run into Deſpair, if we ſhun you, you will judge us as the Authors of mens Condemnation in lulling them aſleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> what then ſhall we that are Miniſters of the Goſpel do who are chiefly concern'd in this matter? The beſt is, not to regard your vain words, but ſeeing the word of Reconciliation is committed to us, let us then, as the Embaſſadors of Chriſt, beſeech poor Sinners ſtill to be reconciled to God; if this will lull them aſleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we cannot help it, a neceſſity is laid upon us, and wo will be to us, if we Preach not the Goſpel; We are not then to neglect our own Duty, becauſe of the Miſconſtruction that others may make of our Miniſtery, the Conſequents that may follow thereupon are to be deferred to the Judgment and Award of Almighty God who will order the whole matter for his own Glory, as ſeemeth good unto him.</p>
            <p>Thus did St. <hi>Paul</hi> in another the like Caſe, though he had in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61822:16"/>1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.2.3. written of the ſudden coming of the Lord, yet when he perceived that ſome were like to take occaſion thereby to make the World believe that <hi>the day of Chriſt was then at hand,</hi> that ſo they might, as it is probable, carry on a pernicious Deſign againſt the whole Doctrine of the Goſpel, he thereupon tells them plainly in his ſecond Epiſtle that <hi>that day ſhould not come,</hi> (2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.2, 3.) before ſuch and ſuch things that he there mentions were firſt come to paſs: He feared not, it ſeems, leaſt he ſhould give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a carnal Security to preſumptuous Sinners (as it is here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected) by his writing of the Protraction of the great Day, but leaves that to their Peril, who ſhall pervert his words and turn them to ſuch a ſiniſter Senſe, declaring the mind of God clearly without caſting ſuch ſcruples as you do. And this may be a ſufficient warrant, once for all, unto us to ſpeak freely of Gods Grace and Goodneſs to the World, not regarding what wicked Perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by the Devil may ſuggeſt unto themſelves thereby.</p>
            <p>Thus Mr. Reflector you ſee your firſt Allegation is here torn in pieces. The reſt that follow are ſo far from being weighty, ſtrong and ſinewy, that they are as light as a feather. So in truth a man may well account of them, for having already driven you from your ſtrongeſt hold, I mean, the holy Scripture, which you may find in my Antidote ſet forth againſt you, I ſhall make little rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of any thing elſe that you can ſay, your outworks I mean may be eaſily thrown down.</p>
            <p>But becauſe I find I ſhall be tedious to my ſelf and others if I ſhould Trace you, as I have begun, I ſhall chuſe in the Sequel to joyn Iſſue with you in a more ſuccinct Manner, and take down your Sophiſtry and mounting Confidence at the firſt bound of them; not that I intend to gather up all the Fragments of your Diſcourſe to give my Reader a taſte of them, for that would be nauſeous, but to ſave my ſelf the labour, and to eaſe him of his trouble in tumbling over your ſtuff, which you have heaped together, I ſhall in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as aforeſaid make my Addreſſes unto you <hi>V.

            <p>Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve's <hi>Salvation is much what the ſame with that of</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <hi>and both equally probable, though they are not certainly known and revealed,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not certainly known and revealed? no more is the Salvation of <hi>Seth, Enos, Cainan, &amp;c.</hi> nor many of thoſe that follow who are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record for holy Perſons though their Obedience to Gods Law was not ſo exact, as the Law did require. But ſeeing the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our firſt Parents is here brought into Queſtion by you, I ſhall ſhew you ſomewhat concerning them, which it ſeems you know not.</p>
            <p>To ſay nothing of what is written of <hi>Adam</hi> (<hi>Luke</hi> 3.38.) where he is ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of God, for as <hi>Cain</hi> is ſaid to be (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the wicked one the Devil as belonging to him, ſo is <hi>Adam</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of God, as belonging not only to his Creation (for ſo do all Creatures, even the Devils) but to his Election of Grace.</p>
            <p>It is written of <hi>Adam</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.20.) that after his Fall and Gods Diſpleaſure made known unto him for it, immediately <hi>Adam</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Wives name <hi>Eve, Becauſe ſhe was to be the Mother of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi> The ſenſe whereof I take to be this (with ſubmiſſion to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Judgments,) <hi>Adam</hi> by Faith here layeth hold upon the Promiſe of Gods Grace. And he doth it in the only way and manner that he could have at that time to give an Evidence of his Faith, that is, in calling his Wife by a new name, a name which he had not before given her, <hi>when the Lord God brought her firſt unto him;</hi> For he now when the Sentence of Death was paſt upon him, calleth her name <hi>Eve,</hi> which ſignifieth Life (whereas before he had only called her Woman, as being one, whom he was to own above all other Creatures for the lovely and beloved Conſort of his Life) implying doubtleſs that though he had been in danger through his ſin, to die in the loſs of Gods Favour for ever, yet was he now fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the gracious Indulgence of God unto him in the Seed of the Woman that not he himſelf alone and his Wife ſhould live, but his Poſterity alſo ſhould be a living Poſterity, and that his Wife ſhould be Mother of him among them, by whom the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death was to be Reverſed, and Life and Immortality to be again brought to light, for, ſaith <hi>Moſes, She was to be the Mother of all living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this ſenſe may be received, let it be conſidered, if this were not the Intent of <hi>Moſes</hi> in this place, <hi>viz.</hi> to give notice hereby of <hi>Adams</hi> Reſtipulation to the new Covenant, here would be a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61822:17"/>ſtrange Incongruity between theſe words and thoſe immediately before: There had God ſeverely threatned to puniſh <hi>Adam</hi> all the days of his life with ſorrow upon ſorrow for his Diſobedience, and that he ſhould in the end be reduced to his Duſt from whence he was taken. Now (ſurely) to a man that was exalted to ſo great an Honour as <hi>Adam</hi> was in his Creation, the ſound of theſe words muſt needs be very terrible, and it might well be expected that at the firſt hearing them, ſomewhat ſhould have appeared of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> Aſtoniſhment, and bewailing his Miſery, but we find no ſuch matter here at all to be mentioned.</p>
            <p>What then? Is all this Thunder and Lightning from Heaven upon him ſleighted, and made of no Account? So it ſhould ſeem, if theſe words of <hi>Adam</hi> concerning his Wife have no coherence with the former, but do only ſhew a kind of Uxoriouſneſs in him towards his Wife. But away with ſuch vain conceits, there is certainly that here added which may well be conſtrued as a due Sequel of the former proceedings of God with <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For when God had done pronouncing his righteous Judgment, what ſhould this poor Malefactor do? Not (certainly) as <hi>Cain</hi> after him did, cry out deſperately, <hi>my Puniſhment is greater than I can bear, but without delay cloſe in with God</hi>'s <hi>Mercy in the promiſed Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here therefore in order thereto is a Deſcription of his Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Gods goodneſs purpoſely ſo interſerted by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſhew (as hath been ſaid) the lively Faith of <hi>Adam</hi> in laying hold upon Gods preceding Promiſe. For though it is to be preſumed, he did humble himſelf greatly before God for his ſin, yet is not that ſo much regarded by the Spirit of God, as this his confident cleav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Covenant of Gods grace, that ſo the Church may take notice hereby that this Covenant was at firſt mutually agreed upon between God and <hi>Adam,</hi> and conſequently that all Mankind to the end of the World who are intereſſed in it muſt be obliged to the conditions of it: For the Act and Deed of the firſt Covenanter (who was the repreſentative General of all that came after him in this Caſe, as well as in the other of the former Covenant) was <hi>ipſo facto</hi> obligatory in their ſeveral Generations, according to the form and Manner, Force and Virtue of all other Covenants that are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al now adays in the World of the like ſort and nature.</p>
            <p>If this then be the true ſenſe of this Scripture (as I believe it is, and will be ſo accounted by the Church of God throughtout the World,) <hi>viz.</hi> that our firſt Parents did in this manner mutually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with God in the Covenant of grace, what an uncharitable man
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61822:17"/>are you to doubt of their Salvation? eſpecially when (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the verſe following) upon their ſubmiſſion and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this new Covenant, God doth immediately alſo take care of theſe his new Covenant Servants that they may be clothed (as 'twere) with his Livery, that their Bodies may be preſerved from Shame and Violence, and that they might know thereby that the Garment of his Righteouſneſs, whom thoſe Beaſts (with whoſe skins they were clad) did typifie, would do their Souls more good, than the Fig-leaves of their own Righteouſneſs could, with all their patching be able to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reflector.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Salvation of Solomon is much-what like to that of Adam and Eve</hi>'s, <hi>and both equally probable though not certainly known and revealed.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing will pleaſe you I ſee but what agrees with your Phanſie. You Queſtion here the Salvation of <hi>Solomon,</hi> becauſe it is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; As if all Perſons mentioned in Scripture muſt have ſuch a Revelation of their Eternal Happy Eſtate there ſet down, elſe you may be at your liberty to judge of them as you pleaſe. It is true much is written of <hi>Solomons</hi> Defection; But ſo there is of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Drunkenneſs as it is called, of <hi>Lot</hi>'s Inceſt, of <hi>Judah</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency, of <hi>Reubens</hi> Deſiling his Fathers Bed, of <hi>Simeon</hi>'s and <hi>Levi</hi>'s Cruelty, of King <hi>Aſa</hi> his Rage againſt the Seer who came to him with a Meſſage from the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But little or nothing is written of their Repentance before they died, yet will no man be ſo raſh as to doubt of their Salvation: Why ſhould you then or your Complices be ſo peremptory as to caſt a ſcruple about the Salvation of <hi>Solomon?</hi> Cannot you be contented with that which is written of him, <hi>Favoris Gratiâ,</hi> but you muſt have a damnable ſling at him, as if he were hovering between Heaven and Hell? But how elſe could you maintain your abſurd Paradox of your hundred Thouſands and Millions of Men that ſhall periſh in their ſins, in compariſon of one that ſhall be ſaved?</p>
            <p>We read <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.1. <hi>whom the Lord loveth, he loveth to the end;</hi> and do we not read alſo again and again that <hi>the Lord loved Solomon.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24. <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.26. yea that this Love was confirmed unto him by the beſt Aſſurance that could be given him, <hi>viz. propter Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam,</hi> the Lord loved him for the Lords ſake, that is, for Chriſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61822:18"/>the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s ſake, in whom all Gods Elect from the beginning of the World to the end, are beloved with an everlaſting love. Did God chuſe him out to be one of his Actuaries of his publick Records to his Church, <hi>viz.</hi> the Book of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> the Book of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtes,</hi> or the Preacher, the Book of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> that pure Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial <hi>Epithalamum,</hi> or Marriage Song, and of two of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> (as the Title of them ſignifies,) <hi>viz. Pſ.</hi> 72. and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 127. And can it be probably thought that he ſhould be dignified in this high Degree, if he had been no better than a wretched Caſtaway in Gods eternal Purpoſe? What, were there not Heirs enough of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation to be inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt for the office of a publick Notary of Heaven, but one muſt be taken from among the Bondſlaves of Hell to make up the number? Was he a Preacher ſent of God, and was not one of his Books called <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> his Recantation Sermon which he writ in his old age when he took a more ſerious view of his by-paſt Life, wherein among other his Follies he ſheweth his Abhorrency of his being miſled by Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I find</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>more bitter than Death the Woman whoſe Heart is Snares and Nets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.26.</note> 
               <hi>and her Hands as Bands;</hi> Implying that though Death be bitter, yet he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die than be entangled again in the Snares of a whoriſh Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Which option may well be juſtified, if we conſider the Aggravations of this ſin, as they are rendred by a good Interpreter,<note place="margin">Biſhop R.</note> one of a Thouſand, and a right Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Preacher among us in our Church, whoſe words are theſe, <hi>viz. They</hi> (that is wicked Harlots) <hi>are more bitter than Death</hi>) more pernicious, and bring more heavy Miſeries with them. We read of <hi>the Bitterneſs of Death</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.32. And of a worſe Bitterneſs, <hi>the end of a ſtrange Woman is bitter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and her ſteps take hold of Hell, Pro.</hi> 5.4.5.</p>
            <p>Death may be ſweetued and ſanctified, made a welcome and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable thing to a Believer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>But the Bitterneſs of Hell is incurable;</hi> Death may be honourable, to die in a good Cauſe (as our King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr comforted himſelf in his Death) to die in a good old Age, to go to the Grave in Peace, lamented, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, with the ſweet ſavour of a holy Life, and many good Works to follow one. But to conſume and putrifie alive under a Tabes of Impure Luſts, to ſhipwrack a mans Honour, ruine his Eſtate, ſhorten his years, conſume his Fleſh, rot his Bones, put a Hell into his Conſcience, to bury his Name, his Subſtance, his Soul, his Carkaſs, in the Boſom of a Harlot, This is a Bitterneſs beyond that of Death.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61822:18"/>
            <p>This now is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> here means and complaineth of. And whether this be a ſound of Repentance, or no, judge you; And if your judgment be of any value, how dare you doubt of his Salvation? Being ſo true a Penitent, as you ſee, neither can you but acknowledge him to be ſo.</p>

               </note> as the word Type ſignifies, He muſt needs be a Reprobate.</p>
            <p>But let me demand of you, is it for you or I to caſt a Figure thus, or create a Type of Gods eternal Decree, concerning Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? We ſhould certainly uſurp upon Gods Power, if what is written in Scripture, we may wreſt it to our meaning without an expreſs warrant from the Spirit of God. And <hi>Polanus</hi> (an Author whom I ſuppoſe you approve of) ſaith <hi>Typi fuerant Figurae a Deo deſtinatae ad Res Divinas praefigurandas.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Syntag.</note> Let us not then be too bold, to thruſt our ſelves into Gods Pavillion by giving our Judgment of things which God hath kept in his own Power. For my part I cannot ſay that <hi>Eſau</hi> was a Type of the Reprobate, much leſs that he himſelf was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.</p>
            <p>This I can ſay, with good probability he was in that Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion admitted into the Church of God by the Sacrament of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſion, as well as his Brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> who though he took him by the Heel at the Birth, ſignifying his future ſupplantation of him, yet could he not ſupplant him in his new Birth, but both were alike Intereſſed in Gods Grace and Favor.</p>
            <p>'Tis true <hi>Eſau</hi> was Prophane in the Act of deſpiſing his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, but ſo was <hi>Judah</hi> in the Act of Incontinency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he was one whom God hated <hi>i. e.</hi> did not love, as he loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> yet I will not ſtretch my cenſure of him ſo far, as to account him a Son of Perdition, as <hi>Judas</hi> the Traitor is. <hi>Luther</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſitive for the Salvation of <hi>Iſmael</hi> (though it be written of him <hi>that he being Born after the Fleſh, perſecuted him that was Born after the Spirit</hi>) and for ought I ſee, we may be as confident of the Salvation of <hi>Eſau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certain it is, his Father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a holy Man loved him entirely from his very Infancy, nor do we find that he ever diſpleaſed his good Father by any undutiful Carriage towards him (except only in his linking himſelf with the Daughters of <hi>Heth</hi>) nor by forſaking the True God, and falling off to Idols; And ſeeing <hi>Iſaac</hi> had ſo great Affection to him, Strangers that knew him not ſhould not condemn him for a Reprobate.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Eſau</hi> according to your words, muſt be not only a Type of the Reprobate, but alſo of the moſt excellent Thing in the World,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61822:19"/>to wit: The Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, under which, a <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> a Sinner obtained the Bleſſing of God, What Senſe or Truth there is in theſe words, let the wiſe Reader judge. The bare reciting them is, to me, a clear Refutation of them. Only a man would think that you who can ſet out <hi>Idea</hi>'s of the true Sons of God ſo roundly with Characteriſtical Signs and Figures drawn at large out of holy Writ, which is eaſie to be done by any man ſtudious in ſearching the Scripture, but not ſo eaſie to find all thoſe Excellencies in any the very beſt of men (for a <hi>quis requiſivit</hi> may ſuffice to bring down their vaunting Pride in that matter, and to ſhorten your Rolls wherein you glory with much Inſultation) a man, I ſay, would think that you ſhould with a ſeraphical ſtrain of Holineſs magnifie the Righteouſneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and not dwindle or ſhrink up that moſt excellent thing, as you call it, in ſo poor jejune unedifying exemplar, as <hi>Eſau</hi> was one whom <hi>the holy Spirit of God,</hi> we may well believe, never intended to ſuch an Honour. But what a ſtout way is this of enervating all the Arguments of your Adverſaries who hold the opinion that is truly Evangelical? If bold words without Senſe, Truth and Reaſon will do it you have done it to purpoſe. But let us ſearch a little further into your Folly, that it may be made manifeſt unto all men.</p>

               <hi>Thoſe Promiſes in</hi> Ex. 34. <hi>and</hi> Numb. 14. <hi>are conditional, and only appertain to them that obey the Commandments of God, and that repent as</hi> David <hi>did.</hi>

            <p>It is much that you do not call them fine Promiſes as you, in Deriſion, do in the 26 Page of your Book. So light account do you make of that which concerns the comfort of poor Sinners, but any thing that may lead them to a Deſpair of their Salvation, you aggravate to the uttermoſt.</p>
            <p>Who ever doubted of this that Gods Promiſes of mercy are conditional, and only appertain to them that obey his Commands? But if you mean here by ſuch an Obedience as the Covenant of works did require, you make the Goſpel of no Effect: And who then can be ſaved? Are you your ſelf ſo exact in keeping Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments that you may lay a juſt claim to the Crown of Life by
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61822:20"/>a rightful deſert, and need not the Paſſion of thy Redeemer? I have that charitable opinion of you, that you are not guilty of ſuch a Phariſaical Arrogance; Be you then ſo charitable, as not to lay on mens ſhoulders ſuch Burdens which you your ſelf will not, nay cannot touch with one of your fingers.</p>
            <p>Had you confuted St. <hi>Paul</hi> concerning this very Scripture, which you have alledged; you would have given a better Interpretation of it, than your words ſeem to carry with them; I mean more agreeable to the Tenor of the New Covenant: read but what is written by him <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5, 6.7, 8. and then, if you pleaſe, tell me your mind, what you think of obeying Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>But it is well that you have added, Gods Promiſes belong to thoſe that Repent; which is indeed Evangelical, but whereas you ſay they ought to Repent as <hi>David</hi> did, inſtancing in many of his words taken out of the 32 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> not at all to your purpoſe; It is true what <hi>David</hi> did in Sincerity, let every man look to it that he follow his example therein, but can you or any man elſe come near unto him in Holineſs, Zeal, Humility, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> The examples that are given us in Scripture of the Piety of Gods Eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are (indeed) ſet for our Imitation, and let our Souls drive our ſluggiſh Hearts hard after them to the uttermoſt of our power, yet let us do what we can, we ſhall not overtake them (neither is it, I think I may ſay, required of us that we ſhould) for Copies muſt ever be more excellent than the <hi>Apographa</hi> that are to follow them, otherwiſe they ceaſe to be Copies: Nor doth God command that there ſhall be in all that are ordained to eternal Life the ſame degree of Faith, ſpiritual Wiſdom and Mortification, but as the Apoſtle faith of Alms 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. ſo may it well be ſaid of all that we do in the work of our Salvation, if there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not; As a Father deals with his Child whom he loveth, ſo will God deal with all thoſe that ſhall be Heirs of Salvation, what Quality ſoever they be of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Thoſe words of St.</hi> Paul 1 Theſſ. 5.9. God hath not appointed us to Wrath, but to obtain Salvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>are to be explained by thoſe of the</hi> 13 <hi>verſe of the ſecond Chap. of the ſecond Epiſtle, viz.</hi> God hath from the beginning choſen us to Salvation through Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the Truth. Your Comment hereupon is this, <hi>God hath choſen us to be ſanctified, and hath ſunctified us, to the end that he might ſave us.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Seeing you will have ſuch an Explanation of the former words by the latter (though ſome would have put a difference between them,) not only in reſpect of the diſtance which the Apoſtle hath ſet in his writing of them (the ſcope of the Writer not being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame in one place, as it is in the other,) but becauſe of the Perſons whom the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth, <hi>viz.</hi> us and you) yet I ſhall chuſe rather to let you know that by the words (which you inſiſt ſo much upon,) <hi>viz.</hi> through Sanctification of the Spirit) is meant the Sanctification wrought in them by the Spirit of God, which may be alſo in millions of millions of Perſons not diſcernable by the World.</p>
            <p>This certainly is that Sanctification which all true Believers are to glory in, not boaſting of any Holineſs or Worthineſs of their own (as Quakers commonly do) but rejoycing in the work of Gods abundant Grace upon them. For you muſt know that which the Apoſtle here meaneth is not ſo much an active Sanctification ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the Life, as that which is paſſive, wherein they are but patients under God, though they do indeed actually receive it into their Hearts by Faith; God begins with his work of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Believer ſeconds it with his work of believing, both which are here joyned together by the Apoſtle, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, In, by, or through the Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the Truth. Whereas if it were an active Sanctification that were here meant, ſuch as is commonly viſible in the Life of a Believer, then may that Doctrine be received again among us which hath juſtly been exploded by us, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are choſen to Salvation for or becauſe of our foreſeen Holineſs, which is that that you ignorantly contend for.</p>
            <p>But you ſhould remember it is Chriſt who is all in all in the work of mans Salvation, and that it is nothing but Faith which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from us, <hi>That no Fleſh ſhould glory in the preſence of God</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.29.) and mark what the Apoſtle there addeth, <hi>v.</hi> 30. <hi>For of him are we</hi> (that is born, of him) <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus, who is made unto us of God Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption</hi> (meaning all that is required of us in this matter.) He is our Wiſdom to inſtruct us, our Righteouſneſs to Juſtifie us, our Sanctification to ſanctifie us, our Redemption to ſave us.</p>
            <p>What are you then, poor man, without Chriſt, what is your Wiſdom but Folly, what your Righteouſneſs but a filthy Rag, what
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61822:21"/>your Sanctification, but ſin at the beſt, your Holineſs no better than the Popes Holineſs, what your Redemption, but everlaſting. Bondage under Satan? From all which good Lord deliver you Talk no more therefore ſo proudly of your Sanctification, <hi>But let him that glorieth glory in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this time I hope you begin to ſee your Error in making ſo falſe a gloſs upon that comfortable word of the Apoſtle, <hi>viz. God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Which word will ſtand firm and ſtrong againſt your ignorant and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd Cavils, yea and againſt the gates of Hell, neither is it weakened at all by that other word of the Apoſtle (which you have raviſhed from the pure ſimplicity of the Goſpel) but confirmed rather.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I conclude your Argument is ſo far from that Nervo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fity you boaſt of in overthrowing the True and Sound Doctrine of the Common Salvation that it is as weak as water. Only it ſheweth how apt you are to catch at any thing in Scripture, though you wreſt it to your own Perdition, which may but ſeemingly ſtrengthen your deſtructive Opinion.</p>

Would any Chriſtian who is right in his Wits ſpeak thus unreverendly of the great work of our Redemption, as you have here ſpoken? Do you not know the Excellency of it in its Efficacy? You might ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have known it partly by the Price of it, not by corruptible things as Silver and Gold, but with the Precious Blood of Chriſt, partly by the Fruits and Benefits that ariſe to us by it, as the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture ſets them out, <hi>viz. we are redeemed from the Curſe of the Law, Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>from our vain Converſation</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>from all Iniquity Tit.</hi> 2.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Partly by the end or final Cauſe, that we may be Conſecrated <hi>to God and the Lamb Rev.</hi> 14.4. <hi>that our ſins may be forgiven Eph.</hi> 1.9. <hi>that we may receive the Adoption of Children Gal</hi> 4. <hi>that we may be reconciled to God.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If you know theſe things, why do you ſpeak ſo doubtfully in this weighty Matter with a may be? As much as to ſay, the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Redemption may be excellent, or it may not be ſo, and whatſoever it is, 'tis only for thoſe whom God hath a mind to ſave, <hi>q. d.</hi> Let Chriſt ſuffer what he will, let him give a full ſatisfaction by his Death to Divine Juſtice for the ſin of the world, yet God hath no mind to ſave any, but a very few, in ſome parts of the world.</p>
            <p>This is your Senſe; But had you ſaid, 'tis only for thoſe whom you your ſelf have a mind ſhall be ſaved, this indeed had been An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to that height you have Skrewed your poor Phanſie up unto, <hi>viz.</hi> To judg the world as you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>But you are pleaſed here to refer it to Gods mind, methinks however you might have found out ſome ſitter Word for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that had been more for the Honour and Majeſty of the moſt high God, than to talk ſo boldly of the mind of God in this Caſe. But poſſible it is thus with you, becauſe you pretend to know the Mind of God, and to be his Privy Counſellor, being that (as I have ſaid already) which hath made you to caſt up your Accounts ſo exactly and judicially of your Thouſands, hundred Thouſands and Millions that ſhall be damned.</p>
            <p>Had you ſaid here (as it hath been wont to be ſaid by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that are wiſe and honeſt) the work of Redemption is only
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61822:22"/>for thoſe that are in Covenant with God, and that believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, this had been according to the mind of God, but theſe terms you were willing to wave, becauſe you know that Faith is the gift of God, and he gives it to whomſoever he pleaſeth, which would have made your Reflection retort upon you, whereupon it is that you talk of the Mind of God at large.</p>
            <p>But hath this indeed been the Mind of God to lay ſuch Reſtraints upon the ſufferings of his Beloved Son that the Efficacy of them ſhall reach but to a ſew? And conſequently hath this been the Mind of God by an Eternal Decree to damn all his poor Creatures who are the Maſterpiece of his Creation for ever except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one in a Million?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.</note> O that ever any that beareth the face of a Man ſhould dare to ſpeak ſo wickedly of God: What is this but to make the Father of Mercies, and the God of all Conſolations more cruel than all the Tyrants that ever were in the World, yea than all the Devils that are in Hell? For they are but Gods Executioners, it is God himſelf that hath paſſed this doom, neither can the Merits of his only begotten Son our dear Redeemer be of force to reverſe it.</p>
            <p>Away therefore with this curſed Opinion, moſt abominable in the hearing of all Mankind. The very Heathen will certainly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor it, yea and hate that Religion which maintains it.

            <p>Chriſt's Prayer upon the Croſs for thoſe that Crucifyed him was this, <hi>viz. Father forgive them,</hi> and the Reaſon why he ſo Prayed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61822:23"/>was not as you ſeem to imagine, For they will Repent; That is far ſhort of his meaning, neither is it ſuitable to that Philanthropy that was in him towards them, nor to the Elevation of his Mind unto his Father, which was fixed, no doubt, upon his Fathers purpoſe to ſave the World by him, of which they were ignorant, for, ſaith he, they know not what they do: From whence it may be gathered that they who ignorantly tranſgreſs as the greateſt part of the World do, may be more capable of mercy than they who ſin preſumptuouſly (as the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>I obtained Mercy, becauſe I did it ignorantly, in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>belief.</hi>)</p>
            <p>We read indeed (<hi>Joh.</hi> 17.20, 21.) <hi>that Chriſt Prayed alſo for them, who ſhould believe on him, through the word of his Apoſtles, that they all might be one in him, that ſo the world may believe that the Father had ſent him,</hi> which otherwiſe might have been brought into Queſtion, after his departure, by the Diviſions and Diſſentions that might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe among his Diſciples.</p>
            <p>But that when he Prayed for thoſe that Crucified him, he did particularly (as you ſay) mark them out <hi>Act</hi> 2.36, 37. who would Repent at the Preaching of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> this is your particular Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, groundleſs and unwarrantable.</p>
            <p>And will you ſtill thus ſhuffle with the holy Scripture to make it ſerve your turn? for it is very obvious to all that read you, why you force theſe Scriptures together that are ſo incoherent. You would like a wary Fencer ward off a Thruſt, which you foreſaw might have touch'd you to the Quick. But fear it not poor man, for it will be eaſily granted you that none but thoſe who are born again ſhall ever be ſaved; But you likewiſe muſt grant that both Faith and Repentance are the gift of God, and that Gods Mercy in the free beſtowing his gifts is not to be limited to time or Means for the Converſion of thoſe that are choſen to Life Eternal (as you may find it clearly proved in my Antidote,) but that this Mercy may be ſecretly and ſuddenly diſpenſed to millions of millions in the World by the gracious Work of the good Spirit of God in and upon the Hearts of men before they die, and that ſometimes in the very inſtant of their departure out of this Life. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, your Accounts will fail you of your hundred Thouſands and Millions that ſhall periſh in Hell for ever, in compariſon of one that ſhall be ſaved.</p>

               <hi>And though there ſhould be but one ſaved for a hundred Thouſand that,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61822:23"/>ſhould periſh and be loſt, yet Grace would ſub-abound in this one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaved, where ſin had abounded, as in the Example of the Thief,</hi> Luk. 23.40, 41.</p>

            <p>The words of the Apoſtle that you harp upon are theſe, <hi>Where ſin abounded,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20.21.</note> 
               <hi>Grace did much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, That as Sin bath Reigned unto Death, even ſo Grace might Raign through Righteouſneſs unto Eternal Life by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A moſt comfortable place of Scripture this is, written on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to magnifie the glorious Grace of God now under the Goſpel, towards poor Sinners that Repent. And will you thus limit it to one particular Perſon, whom you have fancied to be culled out of your Thouſands and Millions, when it is clear, the good Spirit of God ſpeaks it expreſſy of <hi>Adam</hi> and his Ofspring as they generally Iſſue from him in their ſeveral Generations? Are you then and your Complices ſit to meddle with the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture when you underſtand it no better? Better (ſurely) were it for you, if it were as a ſealed Book unto you, rather than be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to wreſt it ſo perniciouſly to your own deſtruction.</p>
            <p>There is a Truth, I confeſs, in what you here ſay; But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you cannot but know that theſe words of the Apoſtle (from whence you gather this your abundant Favor for one probably of your own gang) are of ſo large an extent as hath been ſaid, and that to take them in his ſenſe, were utterly to overthrow your damnable Doctrine, (which rather than you would do, you would pervert them to your own private ſhallow Interpretation) ſince it is ſo, may it not well be ſaid without any offence either before God or Man, you are fitter to be a Hewer of wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> were, than to divide the Word of Truth to Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Had the Apoſtle here written, where Sin abounded, Wrath did much more abound, this it ſeems, would have gone down eaſily with you, as according to your Palate. But bleſſed be the good Spirit of God whoſe word it is, and bleſſed be the Hand that firſt wrote it, it is a word of Mercy, a word of ſtrong Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the whole Church of God. The Magnitude and Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy of Divine Grace being infallibly by the abundance of ſin made the more conſpicuous, as the more deſperate a bodily Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is, the more is the Virtue and Excellency of the Medicine that Cures it, made the more famous and to be extolled.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:61822:24"/>
            <p>Let therefore that word ſtand firm and ſtedfaſt againſt you which you in your eleventh Paragraph of objections have made light ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Grace of God is exalted far above his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Severities, that there where ſin has abounded Grace has much more abounded, for the ſolution hereof is not ſo eaſie, as of many more, though you have pretended ſo of it, to your Reader.</p>

               <hi>As to the Salvation of the Children of Heathen Parents, or others, that is a ſealed Book which God doth not permit us to open.</hi>

               <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is well that you have that Charity for Children, yea for the Children of Heathen Parents, as well as of others, ſo as not to reckon them among your Thouſands and Millions, whom you have marked to Deſtruction, for your only Deſign, (you ſay <hi>Pag.</hi> 27.) in this whole Diſcourſe is, to ſpeak of men deceaſed above an Age ago (ſtill you ſhuffle) and after they had the exerciſe and uſe of Reaſon: It is well I ſay. But you here add, the Salvation of ſuch Children is a ſealed Book, which God doth not permit us to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
            <p>I will not much argue with you about this, though I might, nor inquire by what Authority you call the Salvation of Children, more than of others, who have had the exerciſe and uſe of Reaſon, a ſealed Book, which God doth not permit you to open. Poſſibly you may dream of the <hi>Limbus Infantum,</hi> where Children are kept from the Pains of Hell, not having the Pain of Senſe but only the Pain of Loſs; Which <hi>Limbus</hi> no man could ever open, no, not the Pope himſelf, for though it is ſaid he hath the Key of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, yet the Key of this place appointed for Children is not, it ſeems, committed to his Cuſtody.</p>
            <p>But is the Salvation of Children, as you ſay, a ſealed Book, and is not the Book of Gods Univerſal Judgment, and the Lambs Book of Life ſealed Books likewiſe? Yet you dare, it ſeems, without Gods Permiſſion, yea contrary to Gods expreſs command in Scripture, to open theſe Books, and give your Judgment (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) of them, as you pleaſe. And what is this, but to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the Judgment of the great Day? The Apoſtle <hi>Reaſoned with</hi> Faelix <hi>of Judgment to come, Act.</hi> 24.25. and adviſeth yea warneth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61822:24"/>us (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.) <hi>To judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come who is to be the Judge of Quick and Dead;</hi> Much leſs ſhould we judge ſo raſhly as to determine of the Number of Gods Elect, and that with ſo peremptory a Sentence, as to exclude the major part of Mankind from all hope of Salvation, which is the deadly Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome, that runs through your whole Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>It had been good indeed, if this your Book had been ſo ſealed, that it might have been bound up in everlaſting ſilence, never to come forth, rather than to do that miſchief, which it is like to do among poor and weak Chriſtians who have always been apt to deſpond, and not only them, but among ſuch as are Prophane, to ſtrengthen ſome in their Atheiſm which groweth over-Rampant in this Generation, and others in their Epicuriſm and Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who will be ready to ſay, Seeing there is little or no hope of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for us when we die, let us take our Pleaſure while we may, <hi>Eat, Drink and be Merry.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>It is ſufficient for us Mortals to know that none is or can be ſaved but by Jeſus Chriſt: But we muſt not go about to determine, whether none are ſaved, but who have known Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For us Mortals? a word that you uſe once and again here in your Diſcourſe, becauſe you would (like your good friends the Quakers) take up a form of ſpeech differing from that which is common: Otherwiſe you might have ſaid, it is ſufficient for us, poor Creatures; which would have paſs'd for current better than your word Mortals; For the time will come when this Mortal ſhall put on Immortality, wherein the ſame Truth ſhall be known by us then, which we now know. And do not they that are now Immortal know this that Jeſus Chriſt is the only Saviour of the World, as well and better than we.</p>
            <p>But I muſt tell you, it is not ſufficient for us Mortals (as you call us) to know this, for God hath been graciouſly pleaſed to Illighten us poor Mortals, and thoſe that are Immortal too to know, that none can be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt, but thoſe that are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God. Why then do you by affirming ſo groſs an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, leſſen that knowledge which the Spirit of God in Scripture hath given us, ſaying? It is ſufficient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why indeed, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61822:25"/>you was loth to extend the work of Salvation ſo far as to reach to thoſe Thouſands and Millions, which you will have to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for they alſo may (for ought you know) be in Covenant with God, as well as your ſelf. Men may gueſs at your meaning, Don Doctor, though you ſpeak it not out, as you ought to ſpeak it.</p>
            <p>You ſay further, we muſt not go about to determine whether none be ſaved, but who have known Jeſus Chriſt. Was there ever ſuch a Don known before that will take upon him ſo imperiouſly to judge the World, and yet be guilty of ſo ſhameful Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in the Fundamentals of our Chriſtian Faith? Doth not our Lord himſelf tell us, it is eternal Life to know him? And muſt we not then determine that none can be ſaved but thoſe that know him? know him, I ſay, either by an acquired knowledge in the uſe of holy Means, or by an inſpired knowledge without them, as many Millions in the World I doubt not have attained through Grace, and may alſo for the time to come more and more, one of theſe muſt be abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, ſeeing our Saviour hath ſpoken the word, it is eternal Life to know him. Go then and learn better to know Jeſus Chriſt, if thou thy ſelf wilt look for Salvation by him.</p>

               <hi>All other paſſages ſeem to carry with them ſome kind of probability and likelihood, but they are not convincing, and their Solution is very eaſie; in a word they are nothing ſo forcive as thoſe which are alledged for the contrary Opinion,</hi> viz. <hi>that for one that ſhall be ſaved many hundred Thouſands ſhall be damned.</hi>

            <p>Paſſages you call them. A pretty word for a myſtical Man at <hi>Maudlin Hill Fair,</hi> where he comes with his <hi>Hocas Pocas and Heipaſs</hi> to turn ſubſtantial Arguments into Shadows, or by a nimble ſleight of hand to cloſe them up in a narrow Pinfold of Paſſages to delude the People. But ſeeing you will have them called Paſſages, it is fit you ſhould be paid for your Paſſages with a Demonſtration of your cunning or of your folly; Your cunning in hiding that which would have laid you open to the Eyes of all your Spectators, or your folly in your vain glorious Boaſtings and Triumph that you make by inſulting over the poor Truth your Captive, telling the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61822:25"/>World, thoſe Paſſages for it are not convincing, and their Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very eaſie, and nothing ſo forcive, as thoſe which are alledged for your great <hi>Diana,</hi> the contrary opinion.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, you ſay they ſeem to carry with them ſome kind of probability and likelihood, which is more than any that are wiſe will ſay of your Opinion, as for <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and his followers (whom you reckon among the reſt) I ſhall leave them to be ſwinged by you, as I hear you have threatned me, and do ſo, pay them ſoundly, for they well deſerve it.</p>
            <p>But what will you ſay to that where it is objected that that man to whom God hath given the Grace to pardon all thoſe that have offended him hath a tacite Promiſe that God will forgive him all his ſins. That it is extreamly to leſſen the ends for which Jeſus Chriſt came into the World, to admit that he only came into the World to Redeem one man of a Hundred, of a Thouſand, or of ten Thouſand, or indeed of a hundred Thouſand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it is not to be believed that Jeſus Chriſt at the Right hand of his Father does intercede for one of a hundred Thouſand of all Mankind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Are not theſe Paſſages, as you call them, convincing?</p>
            <p>Or is there no force in theſe that follow, <hi>viz.</hi> that God is ſlow to Anger, ready to Pardon, and ſhew Mercy, yea plenteous in Mercy, as the Scripture often ſpeaks of him, that the work of God and his natural Inclination is to do good to his Creatures, and to pardon them their ſins, that he never puniſhes but with Regret and Unwillingneſs, and that to Deſtroy and to Chaſtiſe rigorouſly, it is his work, but it is his ſtrange Work, and his Act, but his ſtrange Act. That if Jeſus Chriſt would have us to pardon ſeven times, yea ſeventy times ſeven our offending Brother, there is no likelihood, but that God ſhould be much more merciful, ſince he commands us Mortals to be ſo, and if God promiſes to give a new Heart to all thoſe whoſe ſins he pardons, who will believe that God ſhould pardon an infinite number of Perſons, but that he ſhould only give a new Heart to a few, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is there nothing now forcive in all this? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it may well be ſaid of you,<note place="margin">Biſhop Hall.</note> as it hath been heretofore applied, with too much deriſion to an Eminent, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Learned Prelate of our Church, <hi>viz.</hi> that you are an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable Doctor.</p>
            <p>But above all, I am amazed to ſee thoſe two Important Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be thus ſleighted by ſuch a man as you are, who pretend to rejoyce in hope of the Glory of God by Jeſus Chriſt; Both which you interſert among other Objections againſt you, in this manner.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61822:26"/>
            <p>Firſt, that it is extreamly to leſſen the ends for which Jeſus Chriſt came into the World, to admit that he came to Redeem only one Man of a Hundred, of a Thouſand, or of ten Thouſand, or indeed of an hundred Thouſand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is not to be believed that our great Redeemer and Advocate at the Right Hand of his Father, does Intercede but for one of a hundred Thouſand of all Mankind.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſuch things as would make any Mans Ears to tingle that ſhould hear them. But for you, you make nothing of them, and their Solution with you is, as the reſt are, very eaſie. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly were it not that you were too much doting upon your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Damnation (a word peculiar to your own fancy, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was never uſed by any in the World before you, neither was it an unhappy Eſlip of your Pen or Spirit which came from you unawares, for you repeat it again and again in your pernicious Pamphlet, as if you would that the world ſhould take ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it) were it not, I ſay, that you had been too precipitant in running on upon that foot of Account, you would with earneſt Prayer have beſought God to guide you with his good Spirit that you might not err in this weighty Point (which Prayer, it is much to be doubted, you have neglected, becauſe you have erred in the matter moſt groſly.) Yea and now when you may, if you will, perceive, that your Foundation on the Holy Scripture is miſlaid, and that all the Batteries which you make from thence will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coil upon your ſelf with ſhame and ſorrow, you ſhould do your utmoſt Endeavour to Retract your uncharitable Aſperſions, and to find out ſome other ſenſe of thoſe places of ſacred Writ, which hitherto have been, by you and others, but ill underſtood and worſe Interpreted, as your own words are in another Caſe.</p>

            <p>But to our preſent Buſineſs. Firſt I do not like your uncouth word here, Rigor, as you uſe it. A more Reverend Term might in this Caſe have eaſily been thought upon by you, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for your purpoſe, but that your rigid Spirit would have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable Vent according to its Humor whether with Senſe, or without, you cared not.</p>
            <p>There ſhall (it's true) be a ſtrickt and ſevere Examination at that day of all the whole Race of Mankind, all their Thoughts, Words and Works ſhall be made manifeſt and placed in order before them. Gods Law-Book which may be called his Doomſday-Book, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the Law of Works for ſuch as are in a Reprobate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or the Law of Faith, for ſuch as are the Elect of God, ſhall then likewiſe be opened; By both which the ſin of the World ſhall be ſet out in its Colours, I mean as the Apoſtle, It ſhall be made exceeding ſinful (<hi>for by the Law is the knowledge of ſin, Rom.</hi> 3.20.)</p>
            <p>All this and whatever elſe you Mr. <hi>Reflector</hi> can be able to add warrantably from the written word of God concerning that moſt exact ſcrutiny and ſearch that ſhall then be into the Hearts and Lives
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61822:27"/>of all Mankind I do readily conſent unto, for it will be the day of the Lords Vengeance upon all his Enemies who lived and died in their Malice againſt him, and knowing the terror of the Lord, we ſhould all be perſwaded in this our day to know the things that belong unto our Peace, before they be hidden from our Eyes.</p>
            <p>But after all he granted which you can well Imagine what will be the reſult of this Righteous Examination? Will a general Damnation follow upon it? Yes muſt you ſay (for ſo you have ſaid) though moſt impiouſly, elſe your arguing comes to nothing. As for your alienating the matter in the twenty fourth Page of your Book, it is not a retracting of your bold Cenſure: You ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Apoſtle did by the Conſideration of the Terror of the Lord perſwade men to fly to Jeſus Chriſt, but what's this to your opinion of the general Damnation? That you hold ſtill in worſe terms (as may be ſeen in the following parts of your Diſcourſe) than any of your Fraternity (for ought I know) ever did before you, and ſuch as cannot enter into the Heart of Man to conceive, which is not void of all Humanity.</p>
            <p>I will therefore here tell you what, I believe, will be the ſequel of this great Judgment and Scrutiny; I do not ſay it ſhall be for your Condemnation or mine, becauſe I hope and pray that both you and I ſhall before we die, repent us of our ſins, you of your misjudging the World, and I of my misjudging you (if I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended therein) and of my many other failings, wherein I am too ſure I have very much offended; But this I ſay that when the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Uglineſs of ſin ſhall then be diſcovered, an Amazement ſhall generally ſeize upon men for their folly in committing it, inſomuch that thoſe who have been tryed by the Law of Works, and are found guilty of the Violation of that Law (as all unbelievers and impenitent Perſons ſhall be) will ſay to the Mountains and Rocks fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that ſits upon the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb, for the great day of his Wrath is come, and who ſhall be able to ſtand: But others that have been tryed by the Law of Faith, and have thereupon found their Judge to be their Advocate, as I believe a great multitude (not one alone amongſt many Millions) but a great multitude,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.9.</note> which no man can number, of all Nations, and Kindred and People, and Tongues, <hi>i. e.</hi> The major part of Mankind, ſhall find him to be, they ſhall then lay aſide their Amazements at their former Folly; and with loud Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations Chant out their Hallelujahs, aſcribing Bleſſing and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Glory, and Power unto him that ſitteth upon the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61822:27"/>Throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>Theſe undoubtedly are ſome of the immediate Conſequents that will follow upon the Righteous Judgment of that great Day: Some I ſay, for I do not take upon me to determine of all, but only what concerns our preſent purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the beginning of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Sorrows to all the Reprobate, and the beginning of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs to all the Elect People of God.</p>
            <p>I know there will follow the Juſtification of the Judge himſelf, for it is called <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. <hi>The day of the Revelation of the Righteous Judgment of God,</hi> which may be taken not only in an active Senſe but in a paſſive, which will ſignifie that which is written, he will be juſtified in all his ſayings, <hi>and be clear,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) when he is judged, meaning all mouths ſhall be then ſtopped which have been apt to cavil againſt him, and be forced even againſt themſelves to confeſs, the Judgment of God is according to Truth. But to return to our purpoſe.</p>
            <p>You'll ſay, how ſhall they that have lived all their days in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and the hardneſs of their Hearts, (as the greateſt part of Mankind made up of thoſe that are without, alienated from the Life of God, and thoſe that are within, living under the Light of Gods Word, yet have been Ignorant and Prophane) how ſhall they be able to ſtand with any Confidence in the Judgment at the laſt Day?</p>
            <p>Hereto I have already alſo given an Anſwer in my Antidote, to which I remit you. But becauſe you object ſo much that terrible threatning (as you call it) of the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. I will tell you the right meaning of thoſe words, after I have firſt ſhewed you your weakneſs in the Conſtruction that you make of them. You will now, you ſay <hi>pag.</hi> 24. ſpeak a word for the Comfort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting Sinners that examining their Lives, and ſquaring it (you ſhould ſay them) according to that terrible Threatning in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. which frightens them in ſuch a manner as to take from them all hopes of finding Pardon and Grace at the laſt day; It is, ſay you (but the diligent Reader will eaſily ſee your Incoherence here) it is, if thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> were to be underſtood according to the Letter, that there ſhould not be one ſaved, no not <hi>Moſes, Caleb, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua, David, Daniel,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi>

            <p>Strange! But it is no novelty with you to miſ-interpret Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Know therefore thoſe words are to be (and God forbid but they ſhould be) underſtood according to the Letter, for there is as much Comfort ariſing from them to Penitent Sinners, as you can gather Terror to the Impenitent (as is evidently to be ſeen) the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61822:28"/>Inference therefore that you bring from thence is utterly falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that if ſo, there ſhould not one be ſaved, not <hi>Moſes, Caleb, Joſhuah, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay further St. <hi>Paul</hi> would contradict himſelf when he makes mans Righteouſneſs to conſiſt in the Remiſſion of Sins. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you do wrong to St. <hi>Paul</hi> in putting this upon him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to the holy Ghoſt, can you tell where the Apoſtle ſaith Mans Righteouſneſs conſiſts in the Remiſſion of ſins? Have you thus learned Chriſt? Alas man, there is as much difference between theſe two, as there is between <hi>Habitus</hi> and <hi>Privatio;</hi> It was the Death of Chriſt that brought on Remiſſion of ſins, and it was the Reſurrection of Chriſt that was the efficient of our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This doubtleſs is the Apoſtles Doctrine <hi>uti patet Rom.</hi> 4. 25. <hi>He was delivered for our Offences to take them away, and was raiſed again for our Juſtification, to make us Righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you ſay, St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the following verſe makes it plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be underſtood, that he only uſed that way of ſpeech to give Terror, and to perſwade men to fly to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here I muſt tell you Mr. Reflector by the way you have ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act the part of a <hi>Boanerges</hi> (though your thundring Sounds in the Ears of wiſe Men, but as the diſcharge of a Pot-Gun) that it is a hard matter for you to be a right <hi>Barnabas,</hi> as appeareth here by your words which you intended for Comfort.</p>
            <p>For will not the poor deſponding Sinner be ready hereupon to reply unto you, is this your Comfort, to tell me the Apoſtle uſed that way of ſpeech only to give Terror? Alas this needed not, I find it to be true by ſad experience upon my Soul and Conſcience, but I find not here that he doth perſwade me (as you ſay) to fly to Jeſus Chriſt. That which he ſaith in the next words is only to ſhew how neceſſary it is for Miniſters, if they have any true fear of God in them, to be diligent in the performance of their Duty by perſwading men to prepare themſelves for that dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But this reflecteth not upon me for my Comfort.</p>
            <p>In fine, it is true what you ſay, Jeſus Chriſt is our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even of the very worſt of Sinners, ſay I how deeply ſoever they have been drencht in ſin, provided that they Repent and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, their ſins ſhall not be imputed to them, being already im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Chriſt. But it is not true that by his Righteouſneſs our ſins are pardoned, rather you ſhould ſay our Perſons are juſtified thereby, as for ſins they are pardoned by the ſatisfaction which Chriſt made to the juſtice of God through the Blood of the Croſs, <hi>for by his ſtripes are we healed</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 53.5. and thus
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61822:28"/>ſaith the Apoſtle, he was made ſin for us (having born our ſins in his own Body on the Tree) that is now made a Sacrifice for ſin, and when ſin is thus done away, then is Jeſus Chriſt become our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, for ſo it follows that we might be made the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in him.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee Mr. Reflector how unhappy you have been in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the Scripture: Doubtleſs you are an Interpreter one of a Thouſand, but it is the wrong way, for there are but few, I hope, that will be ſo bold with Gods holy Word as you are, in rendring the Senſe of it according to vain Fancy, as you have done.</p>
            <p>But what then, you'll ſay, is the right meaning of thoſe words? I anſwer, the Context will plainly declare it: Some there were it ſeems to me, that would be cavilling againſt the Apoſtle, as if he Commended himſelf too often unto them to whom he wrote, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their approbation of him and his Miniſtery. This Exception he was willing here to remove, We, ſaith he, perſwade men (not upon ſuch a low account as you imagine, to curry Favour with you, but) Firſt becauſe we know, we muſt appear, as well as others, before the Righteous Judge at the laſt Day, and that will prove a woful day unto us if we preach not the Goſpel to you. 2. We appeal to God and your Conſciences to judge of our Fidelity in the diſcharge of our Duty (to the ſame purpoſe in the following words of the 11th. verſe) and this in ſhort I humbly conceive to be the Reaſon why the Apoſtle makes mention here of the Terror of the Lord with a direct Reflection we ſee upon himſelf, I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant there are other Reaſons rendred, but this I may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is one.</p>
            <p>As for your words whereby you make ſuch a pudder, <hi>viz.</hi> of the ſtartling and thundring thereby upon others, which you call Terrors (though the Apoſtle doth not ſo) that is to be taken obliquely not as the chief thing that he intended,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> albeit there be Terror enough in them to drive us all to Repentance.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now (for it is high time) ſhut up this Reflection with an Alluſion to that which the Prophet writeth of the Church of old concerning her deliverance from the <hi>Aſſyrian, Iſ.</hi> 33.22. <hi>The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King, he will ſave us;</hi> Every word is Emphatical, and may well be applied to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord is our Judge;</hi> To him it is (may all poor Sinners ſay, to whom God may be pleaſed to grant Repentance unto Life throughout the World) to him it is that we ſtand or fall. A ſmall thing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61822:29"/>it is (Mr. Reflector) that we ſhould be judged by you, or of mans Judgment, the Lord who is our true Friend and Elder Brother is our Judge, and he will certainly take care of us that we ſhall not periſh. It is true, a Judge muſt not be partial, he muſt give Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence according to Law, otherwiſe he is not a Righteous Judge, well, let it be ſo. But</p>
            <p>The Lord is our Law-giver, our Statute-maker, he hath the Law in his own Breaſt, he can mitigate it as he pleaſeth, yea he can retract it, and bring in another Law in its ſtead more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to us; the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> with the Curſe annexed to it ſhall not be the Rule of this Judgment to us, but the Chriſtian Law, which is the Law of Faith. But what can a Law-giver do if he have not Power? there have been, we know, Law-givers in this World, ſuch as <hi>Numa Pompilius, Solon, Lycurgus, Oſiris, Zamolxis,</hi> and others, that have found their Laws to be of no force, for want of Power to eſtabliſh them, the Law of the Sword utterly broke aſunder the Sword of their Law. But</p>
            <p>The Lord is our King, he it is that beareth the Sword, and he beareth it not in vain, is able to maintain his Law againſt all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Power and to overcome when he is judged, yea and able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all thoſe that will at any time, upon the leaſt intimation of his will, be ſubject unto him. For ſo it followeth,</p>
            <p>He will ſave us; us a rebellious a ſtiff-necked and idolatrous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he will ſave us, he is <hi>ſui juris,</hi> his will is his Law, his Power is Abſolute and Arbitrary, the Power that he manageth in this kind is for the good of his Redeemed, not for their Deſtruction: It is not ſaid, as you ſay, he will damn us all, that were in our Senſe Tyrannical, but, he will ſave us. Salvation is his peculiar Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, the richeſt Jewel in his Diadem, this was the Song of the Prophets of old, <hi>David</hi> ſang it when he fled from <hi>Abſalom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jon.</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>Salvation belongeth to the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 3.8. the Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi> lang it in the Belly of Hell, <hi>Salvation is the Lords:</hi> It was the Song of the Apoſtles, the Grace of God bringeth Salvation, Chriſt is the Captain of our Salvation, the Author of Eternal Salvation, and it is the Song of Heaven, <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the Lord, Rev.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>It is indeed (as an excellent Writer ſaith of it) the Argument of both the Teſtaments, the Staff and Supportation of Heaven and Earth, they would both ſink, and all their joints be ſevered, if the Salvation of the Lord were not, the Birds in the Air ſing no other Note, the Beaſts in the Field give no other Voice, than <hi>Salus Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hova, Salvation is the Lords:</hi> He will ſave us, us ſinners of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61822:29"/>in what dark Corners of the Earth ſoever we lie hid, us ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the viſible Church of what ſort ſoever we be though the moſt heinous, the moſt Obdurate, the moſt deſperate Sinners in the World, whom the Devil hath carried Captive after him at his Will, yet if we will believe, though it be at the very laſt Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, he will ſave us.</p>
            <p>And even your Oracle Mr, <hi>Baxter</hi> hath, by your own Confeſſion here,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 24.</note> in effect ſaid ſo much (of whom it will become you to learn more Moderation in your judgment concerning this matter) even he, you ſay, hath ſaid, that Gods Mercies are offered to us in ſuch a manner, that nothing is required of us but that we ſhould accept them (meaning ſurely, that we ſhould believe) without any thoughts of our own ſo much unworthineſs to hinder us, and keep us from it; that as his Promiſes are of Grace and Mercy, ſo likewiſe are they rich and great; that in truth they are made to thoſe that believe, but alſo that Faith is a Gift of God, that he gives it as liberally, as he grants the Pardon of Sinners.</p>
            <p>The Refultancy of the whole matter is this, he that is our God is the God of Salvation, he will ſave us from our ſins, he will ſave us from the Wrath to come, he will ſave us from the World, he will ſave us from our ſelves, he will ſave us from the Devil, for he is the God of Salvations (ſo is the word of the Prophet rendred) whereas if your word of a general. Damnation ſhould ſtand, you would make him (a word not to be ſpoken without great Horror and Blaſphemy) the God of Damnation: If all the Devils in Hell ſhould Conſpire together to put a diſhonour upon the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, could they imagine a greater?</p>
            <p>Hitherto (Mr. Reflector) I have ſhewed you the weakneſs of your Collections from Scripture, thoſe I mean which you have heaped together in the 5. and 6. Pages of your Book with the Corollary to the laſt of them in the 24. Page.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now ſay ſomewhat to the Types which you have fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to relate to the number of the Elect and Reprobate, as the drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the World, except eight Perſons at the univerſal Deluge, and the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the ſmall number that entred into it, in compariſon of thoſe that did not, the Diviſion of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into two Parties, the Survey that you make of the whole World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe I judge it more methodical to join your other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections from Scripture which you have in the 22. Pag. with thoſe before-mentioned, I ſhall rather reflect upon them, and upon the Preface ſet before them, wherein I ſhall take the ſame courſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61822:30"/>with you, as I have taken before. And thus you begin Pag. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reflector.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I would refer my ſelf to the Judgment of any ſober conſidering Perſon, what a vaſt and almoſt an infinite proportion in number one ſhould find, if from</hi> Adams <hi>days down to ours, there ſhould be a Compariſon made of the ſumm Total of the Elect with that of thoſe who are not Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I believe that this proportion would be of one Perſon ſaved to a Million that is not, that is to ſay, that there is a Million of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates to one that ſhall be choſen, ſo as to be ſaved. Which is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to think on, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt came only into the World to ſave one Man among an hundred Thouſand, or rather a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion: 'Tis an Abyſſe that neither can nor ought to be ſounded,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt you ſay, you would refer your ſelf. It is well that you will at length ſpeak plain Engliſh, and not fob us off with them and they, as you did before to make us believe you were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the point. But you would refer your ſelf, as much as to ſay, you would appeal to the judgment of any ſober conſidering Perſon, as if you thought that any ſuch would give judgment in your behalf, but what ſober man is there in the World who doth not rather abhor your Opinion (I am ſure I have diſcourſt ſeveral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, who do much condemn you) and look upon you, as the moſt daring man that ever ſet Pen to Paper? The holy Scripture tells us that God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the World by that man whom he hath ordained, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is Mounſieur <hi>Lewis du Moulin</hi> become that man? ſtay, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, till you be raiſed up from the Dead, for before that time we can have no aſſurance from Heaven that you ſhall be the Man. In the mean while talk no more ſo proudly of the ſumm Total of the Elect, ſo as to compare it with thoſe whom you in your haſty pre-judging Spirit will not (forſooth) allow to be elected, which will certainly be accounted an Affront put upon the righteous Judge, yea and a charge upon him with want both of Faithfulneſs and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom if he ſhould not give ſentence according to that total Summ which you have taken pains to caſt up.</p>
            <p>You conſider not (poor Worm) from whom it is that you refer your ſelf or make your appeal. You muſt therefore know, is is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61822:30"/>from Almighty God who hath determined this Caſe, before the World was, and hath kept it as a ſecret in his Power, far out of your reach, and it is from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as if you Queſtion'd the value of that Satisfaction which he hath given for the ſin of the World, if ſo, how can you look to be intereſſed in it?</p>
            <p>You ſay next that you believe this proportion (upon ſuch inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) would be of one Perſon ſaved to a Million that is not, that is to ſay, there is a Million of Reprobates to one that ſhall be choſen, ſo as to be ſaved.</p>
            <p>Upon what Foundation, I pray, do you build your Faith? It is not upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But meerly upon the Quickſands of your Imagination, and upon your ſhallow Obſervations that you make of the World in the ſeveral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it. What you imagine in this caſe is not material, and as for your ſurveying the World to ſpend your Cenſure upon men, as you do, who was it that did put you into that Office? though you look upon the face of the whole World during ſome thouſands of years (as your words are,) yea and ſhound viſit all the Families, (as you ſay) and all private Perſons, but cannot find the truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor the Power of Godlineſs in them, may you therefore take upon you ſo preciſely to determine of their final Eſtate? That is, without doubt, to be reſerved to the judgment of the great day. For what think you, can this grent Myſtery of Mans Salvation be perfectly known by Obſervation, and their eternal Election point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to the view of the World, ſo that we may ſay (as a great many Phantaſticks do ſay) Loe here is a Saint, and loe there is a Saint? Hath not our Lord himſelf told us <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.20. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God cometh not with Obſervation,</hi> that is, neither at his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the laſt day, nor at his Appearance in the Hearts of Men by his good Spirit in this day of Grace and Salvation, ſo as to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly diſcerned,</p>
            <p>Or can this Myſtery be comprehended by the diſcourſe of Reaſon, when the Scripture (as I have proved) is ſilent in it, <hi>viz.</hi> with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to particular numbers, wherein nevertheleſs you take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you to be very poſitive? affirming that there is a Million of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates to one choſen to Salvation. A dreadful thing it is, you ſay, to think upon, and I ſay again, it is a horrid Blaſphemy to ſpeak it, which you are not afraid to write, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt came only into the World, to ſave one Man among a hundred Thouſand, or rather a Million. And though you ſay, it is an <hi>Abyſſe</hi> that neither can nor ought to be ſounded yet will you dare to be diving into it, though you venture your Salvation upon it.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61822:31"/>The Lord give you Grace to Repent of this your Boldneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, before it be too late.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reflector.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If one durſt to proceed upon this Subject father than I have done, and well weigh the words of St.</hi> Paul <hi>Act.</hi> 14.16. That God in times paſt ſuffered all Nations to walk in their own ways: <hi>that is to ſay, he left them to periſh in them, one might find that the proportion of the number of the Reprobate to that of the Elect, before the Advent of Jeſus Chriſt, and before the Preaching of St.</hi> Peter <hi>had convented three thouſand men, Is not the number, neither of a thouſand nor of a Million, but of Millions of Millions, to one Perſon that is ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas you ſay if one durſt to proceed upon this Subject far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than you have done, It ſeems thereby you doubt no man durſt do ſo, and well you might; For I believe, no man, who hath had any knowledge in the Myſtery of Salvation, would (if not out of fear of Gods Diſpleaſure, yet for Humanities ſake) proceed ſo far in it, as you have done. The words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> which you quote out of <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16. will not infer ſuch a damnable Concluſion, as you have brought from them, if they be well weighed, as you ſhould have done them; For firſt, albeit <hi>the Nations of old were ſufferd to walk in their own ways, i. e.</hi> without that clear Light to guide them, which now ſhineth in the time of the Goſpel, yet doth it not follow that God ſo left them that they all might periſh therein, that's a ſtretch of your own, and a falſe gloſs that you put upon Gods Providence in his Government of the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What were thoſe ways which they walked in? There is no neceſſity to Interpret them the ways of ſin, unleſs it be of their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry: For there is no Queſtion, but in many of thoſe Nations, if not in all of them, there were allways ſome leading men, who were juſt, temperate, meek, innocent in their Lives, who did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Principles of Virtue into the minds of the common ſort, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they could not well live comfortably together; And I could name you ſome Divines of our Church in former times, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent for Holineſs and Learning who have to this purpoſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of thoſe Nations. Thus ſaith one, Precepts of moral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation have been among Heathens as ſoundly delivered, and ſome as ſtrictly obſerved, as if <hi>Moſes</hi> had taught and lived amongſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61822:31"/>them: Reprehenſions likewiſe of all ſorts of Vices, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of their contrary Virtues they have both wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, faithfully proved, and earneſtly perſwaded, and although they were ignorant of the Joys of Heaven, and the Torments of Hell, yet in their Gentile Learning they ſaw Reaſon ſufficient that the Embracers of theſe contrary Qualities ſhould be contrary-wiſe Recompenſed.</p>
            <p>Certainly (ſaith another) the Civil Virtuous Courſes, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Actions of many Famous Renowned Pagans, ſuch as <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britius, Ariſtides,</hi> and the like were not <hi>mala in ſe,</hi> nor Sins, Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, or evil Acts in themſelves, but good, as the Pearl is bred in the Sea, in a Shell-Fiſh, materially Water, but of Heavenly or Aereal Dew, and in Value and Accompt, for the Clearneſs, Smoothneſs or whatſoever condition it hath, rather reſembleth and referreth unto Heaven, than to the Sea: So ſome Men Naturaliſts in the Sea of this World, have bred, nouriſhed, fomented in them, by ſweet Influx of Gods general Grace and Providence, thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Qualities and correſpondent Actions, which in themſelves ſimply are accepted of by God, do not diſpleaſe him, are rewarded by him.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all this thus far I conſent unto you, if theſe excellent Moralities of the Heathens be not at ſome time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloathed either with an implicite or explicite Faith in Chriſt (as who knoweth but that they may?) That being the Formality and Life of every work truly and Eſſentially Good, they are not ſo accepted of, as to be rewarded with Salvation and Eternal Life. For however they be ſpecious among us here on Earth, it is the Image and Superſcription of Chriſt upon them that makes them Current in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But ſeeing the Work of Faith whereby Chriſt comes to dwell in the Hearts of men may be ſecretly and ſuddenly wrought in them without the uſe of ordinary means, as appeareth by Examples out of Scripture, it may, and ſeeing it may be ſaid of the People of thoſe Nations of old that were ſuffered to walk in their own ways, that they were not far from the Kingdom of God, ſuch of them, I mean, of whom Hiſtory reports that they did excell in good Works, why ſhould you pronounce upon them ſo hard a Sentence as to ſay, God left them to periſh in their Sins? Why indeed? but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are ſtill for periſhing, periſhing upon the leaſt occaſion that you can meet with, and to make ſure of your general Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that it may fall upon your Millions of Millions, for ſo you now mouth it out, in compariſon of one that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>The Opinion of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> (whom you aſperſe from your
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61822:32"/>Scotch Author) of the Heathens partaking of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts word of Chriſt) would have been more tolerable: The virtuous Qualities, ſaith he, and commendable Endowments of Heathens living after <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> were Chriſtian Ornaments and Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſances of that Houſe: For true Virtue is Chriſtianity, That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence, Temporance, Juſtice and Honeſty, and the reſt, they had by a Participation of that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which originally is from Chriſt, and which eminently and properly, though not by them underſtood, is Chriſt. Thus he; This without doubt ſoundeth better than your uncharitable judging. So likewiſe doth the Opinion of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> (for whom you have ſome Favor) ſhew by his words (which I could relate if need were) what he thought of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heathen, before Chriſt's Incarnation.</p>
            <p>You might have added to theſe <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> who were as much of the ſame opinion as the former. Theſe all do clearly ſpeak of the ways that Heathens walked in before Chriſt came; And their words in this Caſe, which I could reckon up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, (but that for Brevities ſake I omit them) are rather to be taken for Sound and Orthodox than yours which tend ſo directly to Deſtruction.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>One might find that in the Poſterity of</hi> Abraham, <hi>which God had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the general Damnation to be his Elect People, and his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Treaſure, there were ſcarce of five hundred or a Thouſand Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites one that was Elected, faithful, and in whom there was no Guile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having driven the Heathen into Hell you now go on to ſpend your Cenſure upon the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, whom you ſay God had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the general Damnation to be his Elect People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with whom you deal as cruelly as you dealt with the former, affirming that ſcarce one of five Hundred or a Thouſand of them was Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is not this alſo a bold Aſperſion? Doth the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture ſet ſo high a Value upon that People, as to account them Gods peculiar Treaſure (as you your ſelf call them) his firſt Born, his Portion, his Inheritance, a holy Nation, with many other Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of ſingular Favor and Honor that are given them, not only when he firſt took them to be his People, but after they had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61822:32"/>againſt him, ſolemnly proteſting unto them that though he would make a full end of all Nations whither they were ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet he would not make a full end of them? And doth not this people to this very day continue in the World to prove Gods Promiſe in this kind to be true? And will you thus judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them all to Hell except one in a Thouſand?</p>
            <p>'Tis true (you may ſay, as the whole World will ſay) <hi>they were a ſtubborn and ſtiff-necked People;</hi> and you may ſay that God hath for a time quite forſaken them; But to ſpeak of them at the rate as you do, with a Reference to Gods Eternal Election, what's this but Intrude your ſelf moſt preſumptuouſly into the Secret of Gods Pavillion? Nor do you, it ſeems, thereby think it any Robbery to be equal with God, in that you take upon you to ſearch and know the Hearts of Men, when you ſay there was ſcarce one among a Thouſand of the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> that was Faithful, and in whom there was no Guile. If theſe things be not to deprive God of his Honour, I know not what is. And if they be not a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to that happy Reſtauration of the Jews which is expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, let the World judge. But you go on Mr. Reflector, to add greater Abominations, for thus you write.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I dare not make any further Advance in this matter, for fear leſt I may be deceived in the Calculation, not in having made the number of the Reprobate too great, but becauſe I have not made it great enough.</hi>

            <p>You have already advanc'd notably againſt the Mercies of God, and the Merits of our Redeemer Jeſus Chriſt But now you ſay, you dare not make any farther advance in this matter. It is a good hearing that you are come to the end of your march. Alas man, what is it that frights you, that you are put to this <hi>Nonplus?</hi> Hath the Captain of your general Damnation met you, that you are in ſome danger to be hurried away by the Millions of Millions that you have liſted under his Power? Or do you begin to Repent you of your daring in that you have done? I would it were ſo for the Truths ſake, and for the Churches ſake, and for your own Souls ſake: No, but it is for fear, you ſay, that you have been deceived in the Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as doubtleſs you have been, and it were good for you to learn a better Art of Arithmetick in this Point, than hitherto you have learned.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:61822:33"/>
            <p>But you are ſo far from that, that you fear you have not made the number of the Reprobate great enough. What, will not Millions of Millions ſatisfie your cruel Mind? This is indeed ſomewhat to your purpoſe of a general Damnation; and what doth it ſignifie, but that you are ambitious to be the prime Feweller to the Prince of Darkneſs, to fill up his Tophet by throwing all the whole Race of Mankind into Hell-fire. Inſomuch that he may now ſave himſelf the labour of walking about, ſeeking whom he may devour, for thou O mercileſs man, haſt done his work for him. But what is it that hath put you upon this divelliſh Deſign? Some great matter will be expected from you.</p>
            <p>As for all the obſervations which you or any man elſe have made of the State and Condition of the World from the Days of <hi>Adam</hi> down to theſe Days, all your ſcrutiny into the over-ſpreading I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, and ſinful Courſe of mens Lives in the ſeveral Ages of it, all of them I ſay, are in this caſe not worth a Ruſh; Yea all your Typical Prefigurations, which you here in your Pamphlet have fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied of the judgment to come, are of no Value; For if the time when this Judgment ſhall be, is unknown to all the Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, much leſs can the number of Gods Elect, taking it but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively as you do, be known to you (poor man) or any other whatſoever, neither can there be, without a daring deſperate Preſumption, any ſcrutiny made into it, ſo as to derogate from the Merits of our Merciful and Faithful high Prieſt Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What then is it that you will pretend unto, which hath put you upon this pragmatical buſying your ſelf in that which is ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove your reach? You ſay you have your Warrant from Scripture-Evidence; For thus you write (meaning that this your determination muſt paſs for current.)</p>

            <p>And now let all men that have any underſtanding in the holy Scripture give their opinion of this Reflector; Would any one but a Fool or a Madman lay ſo great a weight upon ſo ſandy a Foundation, as this Octonary of Reflections ſeems even at firſt fight to be, and which, upon a ſerious peruſal of them, cannot but be conſtrued a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable wreſting of the Holy Oracles of God? Let us conſider them here ſeverally each one by it ſelf, and in ſuch words, as you render them.</p>

            <p>Here I muſt mind you by the way, that as you render the Senſe of the Prophets words to another parpoſe than the Spirit of God intended them, ſo you word it otherwiſe than God ſpake it.

            <p>This being the genuine Senſe of the place, how can it, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſerenity of Conſcience be wreſted to that, to which you apply it? If it be ſaid, it is ſo interpreted by way of Alluſion, I grant, by a Colluſion it is; neither do Similitudes all men know, prove any thing at all <hi>Argumentativè,</hi> only <hi>Rhetoricè,</hi> they may be of ſome uſe ſome times, but not in this place.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Of a hundred Sheep God will leave ninety and nine of them to their wandrings, Mat.</hi> 18.12.</p>
            <p>Rather he will leave them in a ſure and ſafe Fold, or in a good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. God commits his People, that is his Flock to his Paſtors which he hath ſet in his Church, that they may be fed, ſo the charge was given to <hi>Peter, feed my Sheep, feed my Lambs.</hi> He doth not then leave them to their wandring, if ſo, he would have no great cauſe to rejoyce when he returns home with his ſtray ſheep upon his Shoulders, ſweating under his Burthen, where he ſeeth that during his Abſence, all his flock are gone aſtray.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt took a long Journey to the City of</hi> Samaria, which was called <hi>Sychar to Signalize the Converſion of one poor Samaritan Woman, Joh.</hi> 4.4. <hi>to</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>A long Journey you call it: It was a Journey that he had been acquainted with before, for this is not the firſt time that he came into thoſe parts, and he came you ſay to Signalize (a word of your Countrey (poſſibly) or of your own coyning) <hi>the Converſion of one poor Samaritan Woman.</hi> Whereas it appeareth not by all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe that paſſed between him and the Woman, nor by the Report that ſhe made of him to the men of <hi>Sychar</hi> that ſhe was ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61822:34"/>as you imagine; And if it were ſo, ſhe was not the only Convert in that City, for it is ſaid <hi>v.</hi> 4.1. <hi>that many believed, becauſe of his own words,</hi> and the confeſſion that they made of him was much more ſignal, than any thing we read of the Woman, how then did he come thither to convert that one Woman?</p>
            <p>But let all be granted that you ſay of this matter, what is it to your purpoſe? eve juſt nothing, it will ſignifie rather againſt you, that he went thither to open the Treaſures of Mercy and Grace to the poor deſpiſed Samaritans. Is this your Reflection then of any value?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Preſuppoſing that the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were as great in number as the Sand on the Sea-ſhore, yet but a Remnant of them ſhall be ſaved,</hi>

            <p>[Preſuppoſing] and why ſo? Was not the ſame Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham Gen.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Totidem verbis?</hi> and repeated again by the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.12? Why then ſhould any man ſpeak doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in this Point? I confeſs, it is a proverbial form of Speech uſed commonly to ſignifie an innumerable Multitude, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 48.19. but is it not clear hereby, that when any thing is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture that may tend to the enlarging of Gods Mercy towards the World, it is by you but lightly regarded, (as it hath been noted before) whereas any thing that may but ſeemingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance your general Damnation that muſt be ſtretched to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt? So here an innumerable multitude that may ſignifie the Elect of God (in ſome ſenſe) is uſhered in with a doubtful preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, as if the thing were uncertain.</p>
            <p>Well, but this being ſo, what will follow thereupon? Nothing at all to ſerve the preſent Turn; for can any man infer from hence directly that not above one in a Million ſhall be ſaved eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally?</p>
            <p>Admit that the Remnant of the Iſraelites who were delivered from the Sword of the Aſſyrian (which is the proper meaning of the Prophet in that place) were a Type of Gods Elect among that People to be ſaved by Chriſt (as ſome imagine) what's this to all the Elect of God all the World over? Yea and when the whole Nation of the Jewes is reſtored again to their former Glory (as there is no doubt but they ſhall be) it may as well be concluded to be a Type of univerſal Redemption, (which the <hi>Arminians</hi> will be ready to catch at, ſo that then there ſhall be no <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="5">5. <hi>Chriſt had but very few names in</hi> Sardis, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Ergo.</hi>

            <p>A moſt Incongruous <hi>Ergo</hi> muſt this be accounted by all men, but it is of the ſame kind as the reſt are; and therefore there need no more be ſaid unto it, but only to fix a <hi>non ſequitur</hi> upon it, unleſs we may ſay, you wreſt the Scripture from the right underſtanding to a Reprobate Senſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>Of the ten Lepers that were healed, there was but one that returned to give Glory to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence if any thing may be gathered in reference to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation, it may be ſaid (which nevertheleſs muſt not be ſaid) that there ſhall be a Decimation of all Mankind at the laſt day, one amongſt then to be ſaved, or rather it may be you would have it there ſhall be then a Centuriation of Millions of men, that ſhall then be culled out for Salvation which will amount to your reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, but that you reckon, as we ſay, without-Book. <hi>i.e.</hi> without the Records which are laid up in <hi>Archivis,</hi> far out of your reach.</p>
            <p n="7">7. There is incomparably a far greater number of common Stones and Pebbles than there is of Diamonds, Saphirs, and Pearls: And yet Jeſus Chriſt makes uſe only of ſuch as theſe in the Building and Structure of his houſe.</p>
            <p>Grant all that you here ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt makes uſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Precious Stones for the Building of his Houſe, yet what ſtone is there layd, which is not of his own ſquaring, framing, poliſhing, yea of his Creation? And ſurely, ſince he will have his houſe of a large Extent, we may believe he will create materials an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable thereto, for Number as well as for Quality: Yea and rather than fail he will take them immediately out of the Quarry of corrupt Nature into his own hands, to fit and ſmooth them for his purpoſe: of Pebbles and common ſtones he can make them A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, Saphirs, Carbuncles, and what not?</p>

            <p>This, we may believe, you make the main Pillar of your Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61822:35"/>the Reflector hath uſed to maintain the Doctrine of his general Damnation, and how eaſily, as he would make us believe they do enervate and weaken all that may be ſaid againſt it.

            <p>The <hi>Triarii</hi> being thus routed, and the Commander having advanc'd yet farther with a Party of the ſame Spirit, forcing the holy Scripture to wait upon him in his Salleys againſt the Goſpel of our Saviour; We are now to ſee whether the other Weapons of his, ſurreptitiouſly taken out of that Sacred and Celeſtial <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marium,</hi> be well managed by him, and what Edge they carry in them to do him Service, or rather diſſervice to Chriſt and his Church.

            <p>
               <hi>Of ten Thouſand to whom that Holy God-Man Jeſus Preached, hardly will you be able to prove, or ſubſtantially find any thing to ground your Belief that a hundred of them were Converted, whereof the greateſt part thought that Jeſus Chriſt was come into the World, not to eſtabliſh a ſpiritual Kingdom in it, made up of Saints and faithful Souls, but to erect an earthly Empire, and to ſet up Tabernacles in it.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, for the reckoning that is here made of the ten Thouſand to whom Chriſt preached, concerning whom I will not contend, only it may be demanded why ſuch a ſcant number ſhould be ſet of them? Was not Chriſt (as he is called <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8.) <hi>The Miniſter of the Circumciſion,</hi> that is, of the whole Jewiſh Nation? And did he not Preach to others that were no Jewes? For he was <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the Meſſenger of the great Counſel (as the Septuagint Render that written of him, <hi>Eſ.</hi> 9.6.) and doth it not hereby appear that the Reflector writes at Random, as his fancy only leads him, without any warrant? for there is not the leaſt tittle in Scripture of the ten Thouſand that Chriſt came to Preach unto.</p>
            <p>Neither will I much contend about the term that the Reflector here puts upon our Lord calling him God-Man. Our Lord Jeſus
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61822:36"/>Chriſt is indeed God and Man, but is this term, God-Man, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the form of ſound. Words? 'Tis true, Chriſt is often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> God and Man did Preach and Speak ſo as never man ſpake, yet we are told here that hardly ſhall we be able to prove or ſubſtantially find any thing to ground our Belief that a hundred of them were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What then was there any failing in the Doctrine which he Preached, or in the Spirit wherewith he ſpake? Far be from us any ſuch Blaſphemy. The work which the Father had ſent him to do he perfectly fulfilled it: But it was not all to be finiſhed during the time of his Miniſtration, ſome things were to be done by him while he was in the ſtate of his Humiliation, and ſome things after he came into the ſtate of his Exaltation.</p>
            <p>The perfect Converſion of ſinners from Ignorance to the true Knowledge of the Goſpel, and from Unbelief to a full Conſidence or Aſſurance of Faith was not (as it is the work of Gods free Grace) to be conſummated by Chriſt until he was Aſcended into Heaven, and ſet at the right Hand of his Father, for then and not before, was the Holy Ghoſt to be ſent for that very end and purpoſe amongſt many other.</p>
            <p>Which powerful Act of the Spirit was firſt Wrought upon the Apoſtles that they might be inſtructed more fully to the Kingdom of God. For even they, during the time that they were with Chriſt, and were Witneſſes of what he did and taught, were very defective both in Faith and Life. In faith, about the Death and Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, and about a temporal Kingdom, which was their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror as it was of the reſt of the Jews. In Life, when they were too full of Revenge in drawing the Sword, as <hi>Peter,</hi> or for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down <hi>fire from Heaven</hi> upon the Samaritans, as <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John, Luk</hi> 9.54. It was the Spirit after the Reſurrection and Glorification of Chriſt that was to bring all things to their Remembrance what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he had ſaid unto them. It was the Spirit which ſhould then
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61822:36"/>lead them into all Truth. It was the Spirit which, after Chriſt was Glorified, made them clearly to underſtand the Prophecies which went before of him. Thus it is ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Theſe things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not his Diſciples at the firſt, but when Chriſt was Glorified,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It was the Spirit which ſhould adapt and fit them for the great Work of Converting the World, which otherwiſe they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been able to bring to paſs. And as it began thus with the Apoſtles, ſo did this Grace extend unto others in the ſame manner <hi>(ſecundum modum Recipientium)</hi> thus teſtified the Evangeliſt <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39. <hi>This ſpake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve, for the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe Jeſus was not yet Glorified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered we may ſee ſome cauſe why there were not many Converted by the Preaching of Jeſus Chriſt. Yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not a Concluſion be gathered from thence that there were but few then of Gods Elect among that People, unleſs we will exclude the Apoſtles, or at leaſt other the Diſciples of Chriſt from eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, who had alſo their failings both in Faith and Obedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Holy Ghoſt was not then given.</p>

            <p>Let theſe Scriptures be ſearched which are heaped together, and it will evidently appear they ſay no ſuch thing as you ſay of them.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61822:37"/>to the Holy Scripture, which in ſeveral places ſpeaks of them as of a great multitude: But it is certain he ſpeaks it only of his Apoſtles who were his peculiar care above all others: as is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſeen in my Antidote.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt never ſaid that there are but ſew Perſons that enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

There is a great Error that followeth which hath deceived many, and you among the reſt, who have rendred the word of our Saviour here, as if he meant that all the whole Chriſtian Profeſſion ſhould be utterly then Baniſhed out of the World by a general A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy and Defection from the Faith; This I ſay is a great Error that hath gone about the World, and you it ſeems are willing ſomewhat to revive it: But this is not the meaning of our Saviour, for then would the Church be quite diſſolved,

            <p>In the next place you lead us to one of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Viſions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations: But neither doth Jeſus Chriſt, nor his Angel, nor his Servant <hi>John</hi> ſay as you ſay that all the World ſhall run after the Beaſt.

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which are not to be taken for all the World in your Senſe, but for the whole Land or Region where the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Idolatry was ſet up. Neither do the following words, <hi>viz.</hi>

See Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe upon this matter and his Annotations.</p>
            <p>This (very probably) is the right ſenſe of the Spirit of God in thoſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of them therefore which you give, and not only you, but ſome other Expoſitors that have of late taken upon them to make their Revelations of the <hi>Revelation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr. Brightman,</hi> &amp;c.</note> rendring the ſaid words as you do, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61822:38"/>whole World ſhall run after the Beaſt, meaning the Pope and his Idolatrous Worſhip, cannot be good; much what like unto that which hath been gathered falſely from this Book of the <hi>Revelation, viz.</hi> that the People are they, that muſt pull down Antichriſt, whilſt Kings eſpouſe his cauſe, than which nothing can be more effectual and direct (ſaith Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>) towards the raiſing and fomenting of Commotions in the World; which is certainly contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But let me now here demand of all thoſe that have been of your mind, what is all this to your purpoſe? ſurely nothing. Yet, if it were ſo, as you ſeem to ſay, that there ſhall be a general Defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or falling away to Romiſh Idolatry, ſo that all Nations and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World ſhall run after the Beaſt, will it neceſſarily follow that God from everlaſting decreed that not above one in a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Millions ſhall ever be ſaved? Cannot a true faith be wrought in the Hearts of Idolatrous People before they depart out of this World? is any thing too hard for God? It is no novelty, for the Spirit of God to work ſuch a Converſion ſecretly, ſuddenly, in a way unknown to the World, and to deliver People at the very laſt moment of their Lives out of the Snare of Satan, as Brands pluckt out of the Burning. And do not you tell us even the very ſame thing in the 29. Page of your Book that Jeſus Chriſt will ſave thoſe that have truly Repented, though even at the laſt Period of their Lives?</p>
            <p>Such gracious Acts of Gods infinite Goodneſs have been done upon thoſe that ſeemed to be as Caſtaways in the Eye of the World, and doubtleſs may be done again. Gods Arm is not ſhortned, nor his Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els leſs yearning towards his poor Creatures that are ready to periſh in their Sins, through the malice of Hell, which hath originally brought them into that wretched Condition. But of theſe things enough hath been written in the aforeſaid Antidote, no need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here to write of them again.</p>
            <p>As for that which is here added about the number of the Elect in compariſon of thoſe that are called, enough alſo hath been ſaid thereof in the Antidote aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Scripture-Evidences which the Reflector hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to maintain the dreadful Doctrine of a general Damnation. All which the wiſe and pious Reader will now ſee to be far ſhort of proving that which is ſo ſtoutly affirmed in the Title-Page of his Book of Reflections, <hi>viz.</hi> That not one of a hundred Thouſand, (nay probably not one in a Million) from <hi>Adam</hi> down to our times ſhall be ſaved. Or as the ſaid opinion is ſtretched in the 21th Page
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61822:38"/>of the ſaid Book, <hi>viz.</hi> the proportion of the number of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate to that of the Elect, before the Advent of Jeſus Chriſt and before the Preaching of St. <hi>Peter</hi> had Converted three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, is not the number, neither of a Thouſand, nor of a Million, but of Millions of Millions to one Perſon that is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>There yet remains one Reflection more which will require ſome animadverſion upon it, that is, the <hi>Idea</hi> or Character (as the Reflector calleth it) of the Children of God, made by himſelf in ſetting a multitude of Marks and Signs upon them, without which, he ſaith, they cannot be ſaved, all which he makes the eſſential and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent Parts belonging to every true Chriſtian. And from thence he imagined, that his opinion of the general Damnation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be a certain truth, becauſe they are not all to be found in one man amongſt a Million.</p>
            <p>But <hi>feſtina lentè</hi> (as we ſay) for haſte makes waſte, are theſe all, being about thirty of them, to be found together in one man? I believe, without any breach of Charity, they were not all to be found in himſelf that ſo compiled them? elſe he would never have been ſo uncharitable, nor ſo unrighteous, as he was, in his paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate raging Heats againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor, in accuſing ſeveral of the moſt Eminent Champions of the Goſpel in it againſt the Superſtitions of <hi>Rome,</hi> laying to their charge things which they knew not, as that they leaned to Popery, and had made their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces towards <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein, by his own Confeſſion upon his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, he thought they were not guilty, wiſhing that his Soul might be with their Souls whom he had ſo much and unjuſtly defamed, but let that go.</p>
            <p>This I may ſay boldly, to glean the holy Scripture, raking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſeveral Duties of Piety, Charity, Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in it, and to annex unto them ſuch a terrible Threatning as this, <hi>viz.</hi> without them there can be no Salvation, this cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the Spirit of the Goſpel: Had it been ſaid, without Faith and Repentance no man can be ſaved, I for my part would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily have ſubſcribed thereto. But as that Legiſlator had ſtated the Caſe, deſignedly to give ſome corroboration to his unevangelical Opinion, he ſeemed to me to be as one ſent from <hi>Moſes</hi> with two new Decades of Laws, more dreadful than the Decalogue proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, as for the Violation of that Decalogue we hear a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſound, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous is the Propitiatory (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2.) meaning doubtleſs that ſuch a Violation ſhall, upon true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61822:39"/>pentance, be ſo hidden by Chriſt, that it ſhall never appear in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Condemnation to any that believe (for in thoſe words the Holy Evangeliſt alludeth to the Mercy-Seat which covered the Ark of the Covenant from the ſight of God, (where the Tables of that Law lay) But for the Violation of theſe Laws which come out of <hi>Sion</hi> (as being written in the New Teſtament) there is no Propitiation: for where there is a failing in theſe, we are told there can be no Salvation.</p>
            <p>But let us conſider the matter a little better. It were an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing indeed, and as it were a Heaven upon Earth to have ſuch a Characteriſm upon us while we live in this preſent evil World, and let us on Gods name preſs toward it as the Apoſtles word is, <hi>Phil. 3.</hi> that if by any means we may attain (not only to the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to which all Mankind ſhall attain but) to the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that's the word, the glorious Reſurrection of the Dead; Let us be ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded (for for ſo the Reflector Characteriſeth the Elect of God) which is, ſo to know the things of the Spirit, as to believe them; ſo to believe them as to affect them and eſteem them, ſo to eſteem them, as to ſeek them, ſo to ſeek them, as to ſeek them in the firſt place, let us abſtain from carnal and worldly Luſts, let our Thoughts and Meditations be more ſet upon God than the World, let us live Soberly and Righteouſly and Holily in this preſent evil World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nevertheleſs if in theſe or the like any of us ſhall come ſhort of the Glory of God, or of the Glory from God, meaning Gods Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and Approbation (as it muſt be confeſſed with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in many things we offend all, and too many offend in all) we are comforted from the Evangeliſt, we have an Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1.</p>
            <p>Having yielded thus much in this Point, let me now Expoſtulate a little with the Diſciples of this Reflector concerning theſe things; Is it agreeable with the Senſe and Scope of the Goſpel of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to multiply ſignal Demonſtrations of Gods elect Children, by impoſing Duties upon them, as if they were all exactly to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without any the leaſt digreſſion from the Rule, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any mention at all either of Gods Grace aſſiſting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling thereto, or of Gods Mercy by Chriſt in pardoning the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of them. adding only the Condemnation (as the Reflector hath done) that ſhall fall upon thoſe, in whom thoſe marks are not to be found? What Thunder and Lightning from <hi>Sinai</hi> could be more dreadful? could any thing be ſaid or written more conſonant to the Covenant of Works? Upon this account, I confeſs, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of general Damnation may prove to be, according to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61822:39"/>ſaying, as true as Goſpel: but what then will become of the Covenant of Grace; and conſequently of the comfortable Doctrine of Salvation? will it not by this means be utterly annulled, and made of no Effect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What did the Reflector mean, when he ſaid that in our days we can meet but few that labour to take the Kingdom of Heaven by Violence? What, but that he would catch at any thing that would but ſeem to hold up his Opinion of the ſmall number of perſons that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>For I demand, is the Kingdom of Heaven in theſe days to ſuffer violence, and do the violent take it by force according to Chriſt's meaning when he ſpake thoſe words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.12. Certainly if that be a good Expoſition which I have read an Interpreter one of a Thouſand hath given of them, <hi>viz.</hi> that the multitude and meaner Crowd of the Jews who had heard <hi>John</hi>'s Preaching came and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to the Rules of the Goſpel, together with the Publicans and Sinners, who were all lookt upon by the Jews, as thoſe that were accurſed, and had no right to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and ſo were accounted as violent Perſons, Invaders and Intruders upon thoſe Priviledges which they imagined did peculiarly belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. If this, I ſay, be the true and genuine Senſe of thoſe words, as in all likelihood it is, how can they be ſo ſtretcht, as they are wont to be to ſuch an uſe and purpoſe as is commonly made of them?</p>
            <p>I deny not but we may therehence obliquely infer that a holy Zeal in the Service of our God is good and commendable that we are to ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, to ſight the good fight of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to argue from thence that few in theſe days do take the Kingdom of Heaven by Violence, therefore few ſhall be ſaved, is not to be endured, being both <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> abſurd and Irrational.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Reflector did take his marks amiſs, for the greateſt number of them, and that they are defective in ſundry particulars, as Coincidence, Tautology, vain Repetitions, Contradictions, Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations of holy Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be eaſily proved if we ſhould inſiſt particularly upon them. Some of them ſhall be here produced to that purpoſe, to give an eſſay of the reſt, <hi>v.g.</hi> It is ſaid the Elect of God are to be regene rated, and that they are paſſed from the ſtate of Nature into a ſtate of Grace: And what difference is there between theſe two? are they not both one and the ſame? And how often is this repeated by the Reflector? It is the common <hi>Crambe</hi> in his Book, <hi>ad nauſeam uſque.</hi> Though Regeneration be much
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61822:40"/>talkt of, yet is it but little underſtood. True, the Power of it is to be evidenced in the courſe of our Lives: But the firſt working of it is (without doubt) in our Baptiſm, wherein, as our Church Liturgy teacheth us, <hi>we are made Members of Chriſt, the Children of God, and Intheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> And what doth this ſignifie, but that we have then paſſed from the ſtate of Nature into the ſtate of Grace? Hence it is that the Miniſter, after we have been Baptiſed, pronounceth openly before the whole Congregation, that we are then regenerated and grafted into the Body of Chriſt's Church. And the Church likewiſe there declareth it to be certain by Gods word that Children which are Baptiſed, dying before they commit any actual ſin, are undoubtedly ſaved. All which do agree with the Apoſtles Rules, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>If then we are Regenerated in our Baptiſm, and are thereupon changed from the ſtate of Nature into the ſtate of Grace, and it be granted that theſe are the marks of the Children of God and of the Members of Chriſt, can any man paſs a definitive Sentence upon us that we belong not to the number of Gods Elect?</p>
            <p>I know and acknowledge there is ſome difference between an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Profeſſion of Religion which we take upon us in our Baptiſm by Water, and between a Practical Conformity to the Rules of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and the Example of Chriſt, which Conformity is the Effect of our inner Baptiſm by ſire, and which will be viſible in the courſe of our Lives: But even this is not limited to any certain time; for the work of Regeneration is never at an end while we live in this World, it is indeed ſomewhat like to the ineffable Generation of the Son of God which never ceaſeth, being as the School men ſpeak of it, <hi>Actus commenſuraſtes Aeternitati,</hi> of the ſame ſize with Eternity, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and everlaſting Generation, ſo our New-Birth or Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is not a tranſient Act, but a permanent and continued Act, an Act which is ſtill in being all the days of our Lives. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe I have heard a moſt Learned Divine, Dr. <hi>Collins</hi> by name who was in my time Provoſt of <hi>Kings</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Regius</hi> Profeſſor of Divinity in that Univerſity deliver his Judgment at a Publick Commencement there, in theſe words, <hi>Quotidie Renati ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> we are every day Regenerated. Which being ſo, what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can any man make by the work of Regeneration in us, of our eternal Election, ſo as poſitively to determine ſuch an one is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated therefore he ſhall be ſaved, and ſuch a one is not Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, therefore he ſhall be damned? The holy Apoſtle would that we judge nothing before the time.</p>
            <p>It will be ſaid, may we not then judge of men, as we find them?
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61822:40"/>If they live Righteouſly, Soberly and Holily, ſo far as can be diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by men, may we not ſay ſo of them? yes without doubt, if we go no further in our judging: But to judge of Gods eternal Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereby, what is it, but to anticipate Gods Judgment (as it hath been ſaid before) It is to intrude our ſelves into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of Gods Pavillion, it is to invade Gods prerogative, it is an Arrogancy God will never endure. Yet is this a part of that courſe which according to the Reflectors arguing we are to take in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the number of Gods Elect.</p>
            <p>Another of his marks is to live in the Joys of the Holy Ghoſt, poſſeſſing a peaceable ſerenity of mind, and an undiſturbed Quiet of Soul, without which it is concluded no man can be ſaved. And this is again repeated in the ſame words. Religion conſiſts in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Serenity of Joy, Peace of Soul, Tranquillity of Mind. But what then will become of a broken Heart, of a wounded Spirit? what? The Prophet <hi>David</hi> who knew better the Mind of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and Merciful God, will tell ſuch for their comfort, they are Gods Sacrifices, which he will not deſpiſe, what account ſoever they be made of among uncharitable Men.</p>
            <p>It were too much to follow the Track of all the Reflections which hath been made of this matter. I think I have purſued the chief of them with a tolerable Reverberation, only before I conclude, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but proteſt againſt the ſtrange and vehement Aſſeverations that are uſed in the carrying on of this pernicious Doctrine. It is ſaid to be as great a Truth as any can be in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no Salvation but among Chriſtians, and that the greateſt number of the Elect is amongſt the Reformed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But can a man with any ſerenity of Soul and Conſcience ſpeak thus confidently of Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Counſels and Decrees? And what a bold and daring Affront is this which is put upon divine Truth, to affirm that this Opinion of the ſmall number of Gods Elect, ſo limited as is here ſet down is as great a Truth as any can be in the World?</p>
            <p>Surely that which was once unjuſtly laid upon a Pious and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prelate of our Church by ſome Miniſters in and about <hi>London</hi> may moſt juſtly be here applied, <hi>viz.</hi> Is this as great a Truth as any can be in the World? what is it not a more certain Truth that there is a God? Is it not a more certain Truth that Jeſus Chriſt is God and man? Is it not a more certain Truth that Chriſt is the only Saviour of the World? As great a Truth as any can be in the World? Muſt this then be an Article of our Creed, the Corner-Stone of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, muſt this be of neceſſity to Salvation? No greater Truth than this, which is no Truth at all? O that men ſhould not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61822:41"/>themſelves, but God alſo, and in their Zeal for their own vain Fancies, utter words bordering upon Blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>I cannot likewiſe but proteſt againſt that which is written Page 23. where complaining of the neglect of Piety in this Age, which is too true, and a thing much to be lamented, it is ſaid that many maſters of Families, otherwiſe Sober, Civil, True, Honeſt, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Dealers, and good Friends have wholly neglected Family-Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God forbid that I or any man ſhould ſpeak or write a word againſt the Religious Exerciſes of good Chriſtians in private! that is and ſhall I hope be ever far from me, let them ſtill be continued in their due order, provided that the publick ſervice of God, as it is now in uſe among us here in this Church and Nation, be not thereby ſleighted and brought into Contempt, as it hath been in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, eſpecially in populous Cities and Towns: Nay it were much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the Family-Duties were wholly omitted, than the publick Worſhip of God in our Churches and Congregations ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed.</p>
            <p>The Church certainly hath taken great care for her Children in this matter, appointing a method to be commonly uſed in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God twice a day throughout the year morning and evening, commanding the Holy Scripture to be read ſo daily, that the Old Teſtament ſhall be read once every year, and the New Teſtament thrice. And were it ſo that the Church-Liturgy were exactly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in every Church throughout the Nation, Miniſters and People heartily joyning together, as the Common-Prayer-Book doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, what a Nation ſhould we be of holy Zealots for Gods Glory? Glory would then certainly dwell in our Land, and never till then? Jeſus Chriſt would be in his Throne amongſt us, and God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in us as his peculiar People. Then ſhould we not need to fear the Encroachments of Popery upon us any more, if we had once this Unanimity and uniformity ſetled among us in the daily ſervice of our God, O that God would be pleaſed yet to open the Eyes of the People of this Nation, both high and low, to ſee and underſtand this one needful thing, that will above all things elſe bring Peace unto us, and eſtabliſh it.</p>
            <p>Let Family-Duties I ſay again be performed in their due time, place and order, but let them yield the precedency to the publick, which of late years they have not done, the greater is our ſin: Yea though the private Piety and Zeal, I mean that which is according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, hath been the Fruit and Offspring of the publick Service of our God, yet through the Malice of the Devil it hath come to paſs that the old word is verified in our Land, <hi>Filia devoravit Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem,</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:61822:41"/>the Mother which under God give a Being to the Daughter is devoured moſt viperouſly by her own Iſſue, and the Daughter is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked up in her ſtead. And though a ſpurious Brood of Errors doth commonly ſpring from her, yet will ſhe pretend that all ſaving Truth is confined to her private Conventicles. Let this then be done and there will be no need to complain any more of the omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Family-Duties. Nor let any be ſcandalized at that which is here written in the behalf of our Book of Common-Prayer, but for <hi>Lewis du Moulin</hi>'s ſake let men have better Thoughts of it who while he was in his Health and Jollity did poſſibly joyn with others in a prejudice againſt it, but when he ſaw Death the Sergeant of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ready to lead him before Gods Tribunal, he then was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, to which purpoſe ſomewhat ſhall be here related of that which is publiſhed of him by a good hand when he lay dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Du Moulin</hi> having ſent to the Reverend Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi> Dean of <hi>Peterborough</hi> to deſire a Viſit from him, being of his Pariſh, the Dean immediately upon the Evening of the ſame day went unto him, and was Entertained with many Expreſſions of great Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, and high Eſteem of him, when after ſome comfortable words ſpoken to the ſick man, he endeavoured with meekneſs to convince him of his great Offence againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which he had wronged Intolerably to the great Gratification of its Enemies, at ſuch a time when all ſober Men ſhould be its Friends, and without any real Cauſe for ſuch imputations as he had charged upon it, Whereupon Dr. <hi>Du Moulin</hi> replyed ſomewhat, needleſs here to be repeated, but yielded thus far, as to ſay, well Doctor, pray to God to pardon me all my Sins, eſpecially my want of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the Dean kneeled down by his Bed ſide and began with the Lords Prayer, ſo proceeding to the other Prayers, which are appointed by the Order in the Common Prayer-Book for the Viſitation of the ſick, in all which the ſick man joyned with lifting up his hands often, and other Expreſſions of Devotion; Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at that paſſage (in the Prayer, when there appears ſmall hope of Recovery) <hi>give him unfeigned Repentance for all the Errors of his Life paſt, &amp;c.</hi> He gave more than ordinary ſigns of his fervent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and when the Dean had done he gave him moſt hearty thanks, and renewed his Expreſſions of extraordinary Affection to him and eſteem or him.</p>
            <p>A little after, the Dean coming to ſee him again, he was ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with his Kindneſs in giving him a new Viſit, that he ſaid,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61822:42"/>
               <hi>Are you come again Sir? O how charitable are you! This is indeed to return me good for evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after ſome diſcourſe with him, deſired him to Pray with him again, for your Prayers, ſaid he, were very comfortable to me the laſt time. And accordingly he did, in the ſame form of words he had uſed before: With which he was ſo much affected, that when the Dean had ſolemnly commended him to Gods Bleſſing, in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Form; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto Gods gracious Mercy and Protection we commit thee, the Lord bleſs thee and keep thee, &amp;c.</hi> he laid hold upon his hand (which he held up over him) and kiſſed it with an unuſual Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Such an Example as this one would think ſhould incline People who are apt to ſpeak evil of that excellent Form of Prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Church in that Book, and of the whole Method of Divine Service in it, to be much humbled before God for their depraving it, and to make better uſe of it, than hitherto they have done, by making it their daily Rule for the ordering of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and Family-Duties and Devotions with Reverence and godly fear.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing that I ſhall here take notice of is that which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded toward the cloſe of theſe Reflections, <hi>viz.</hi> a plain contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, and which overthroweth all that is before written of the general Damnation, in theſe words, They that find there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Wickedneſs in them, and Death by ſin, and that they have only the name of Chriſtians, and have denied the Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that they deſerve for ever to be caſt out of the preſence of the Almighty, may have hope; for even in that miſerable and much to be pitied Eſtate God Counſels the ſinner to make uſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that he offers him, and to touch the Scepter of Grace which is extended to him, which will infallibly work the Salvation of the Soul; for God's ways are not like to mans, nor are his Thoughts like to thoſe of ſinful fleſh, his Ways and Thoughts are inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, the height and depth of them immeaſurable towards ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that Repent: where by the ways of God you are to underſtand thoſe of his Mercies, and not thoſe of his Knowledge and Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>This I muſt ſay ſounds well, and I wiſh that all the reſt that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in that Book of Reflections had agreed thereto, but there is as much difference between this and them as there is between the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of White and Black. I have been willing to add this in the cloſe, that if ever it ſhould happen theſe Papers may come into the Hands of any Diſconſolate Soul, it may ſee that here both from the Reflector and my ſelf which may bring ſome comfort unto it.</p>

               <p>IT is much to be Lamented that there have been ſo long a time perverſe Diſputings and uncharitable Diſſentions about theſe words among thoſe who are or ſhould be partakers of the ſame Precious Faith, when if they were underſtood aright, it might well be preſumed, that inſtead of Animoſities and fiery Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which have too much abounded, a ſweet Peace and Brotherly Accordance had ere this time happily overſpread the Chriſtian World, to the Adorning of the Doctrine of God our Saviour, even among thoſe that are without.</p>
               <p>It is not too late yet for us to uſe our utmoſt endeavour towards the making up of this Peace, I ſay not, by affording any Connivence to Error, but, by rendring an Interpretation (rational in the Judgment of all men) of theſe words, which may poſſibly be a great furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance unto it: And if my poor Judgment may be of any Value, I think (after fifty years Employment that I have had in the work of the Miniſtery) that ſuch a ſenſe may be given of them, which, though it be not to be found in the common Road of Expoſitors, yet may lead all ſorts of People of what perſwaſion ſoever they be (if they be not poſſeſſed with a Spirit of Contradiction) to the neareſt way of a right Underſtanding, the meaning of our Saviour in them, and conſequently to a more peaceable and chriſtian-like Living to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the World, and loving one another than hath been among us in former times.</p>
               <p>True it is, Satan hath prevailed mightily in this his Maſter-piece of Miſchief, to ſow Diſcord and Variance about that very thing, which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Prince of Peace, hath ordained to be a means to unite his People together in Love.

               <p>Thoſe who are and will be of the Roman Schiſm, are indeed very free alſo in making their Complaints of theſe unhappy Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences: I wiſh that it could not be a true Imputation put upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> A main Cauſe of all this Quarrelling in this Point hath chiefly had its original from them.</p>

                  <hi>Ferus (Moguntinus Concionator</hi> as he is called) one of the greateſt Moderation among them, cryeth out in this manner, <hi>O dolor ſuper dolorem, quod Eccleſiam conjungere deberet, per hoc ipſa vel maximè diſcerpitur &amp; ſcinditur, quod ad Pacem &amp; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nioneni ſervire deberet, eo vel maximè utimur ad excitanda Bella, Diſcordias, Sectas, i. e.</hi> O Grief of all Grieſs! that which ſhould knit the Church together in Love and Concord, even by that very thing is it chiefly divided and rent in pieces, that which ought to work Peace and Union, we chiefly make uſe of to raiſe and foment Wars, Diſcords and Schiſms. Thus he, And why then will they (and he among the reſt) be ſtill ſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious as they have a long time been, in maintaining their corrupt and prodigious Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation?</p>
               <p>A Doctrine but of yeſterday, not known in the Church, till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Thouſand years after the Goſpels firſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the World;<note place="margin">Biſhop Hall.</note> So young it was (ſaith a Pious and Learned Prelate of our Church) that it had not before learned to ſpeak, he and ſundry other Authors of very good Account affirming that this word Tranſubſtantiation, whereby the Roman Church underſtands the turning of the Sacramental Bread into the Body of Chriſt, was never mentioned, or heard, or thought of among the antient Fathers, or in the Primitive Church: Only about ſix hundred years now paſt, Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the ſecond (ſome ſay it was <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, ſo <hi>N. D.</hi> a Popiſh Writer againſt our Martyrologiſt) in the Lateran Council did ſet forth, Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and confirm to the utmoſt of his Power that opinion of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubſtance of the Bread in the Sacrament (as for the Cup their heat doth not reach ſo much againſt that, which is the Reaſon that this Diſcourſe is moſtly of the Bread) and would have made it an Article of Faith, and did what he could to have it placed in the Creed, whereupon there enſued <hi>Corput Chriſti</hi> Day, Maſſes of <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> and the like Novelties never before known or brought into Uſe, Practice or Obſervation in any part of the World: Yea
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61822:43"/>hereunto do they themſelves (the Papiſts) give their Conſent (which they could not poſſibly avoid) that this word Tranſubſtantiation was not uſed before the time of the ſaid Councel; Yet to keep themſelves from a total Defeat herein, they do withal affirm that the Doctrine of it was held in Effect and Subſtance from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the Antient Fathers, and maintained by them in other terms, ſuch as Mutation, Tranſmutation, Tranſelementation, Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Bread, and the like. Nevertheleſs this Evaſion will not ſerve their turn, for though they yield us thus much, in this Point, confeſſing this word to be a Novelty, as they apply it to the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, yet, is it not (let all mankind judge) an abſurd Vanity for any man to Imagine that the ſaid Doctrine ſhould be ſo generally own'd, and ſo fiercely maintained, yet not a fit word to be found out by any in that long Tract of time, to ſhew to the World the full meaning of that Doctrine? For, as for thoſe words which they ſay were then uſed, what do they ſignifie, but the ſame ſenſe, which we (who are and muſt be their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries in this and many other Points of our Chriſtian Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) do and always have acknowledged, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a change in theſe outward Elements, being turned from a common to a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Uſe, after they are Conſecrated and ſet apart according to the firſt Inſtitution? Which certainly was the meaning of the Antients in this Caſe, and no otherwiſe (as ſhall appear hereafter from very good Authority) though, 'tis true, their Zeal did oftimes lead them to many ſtrains of Rhetorick in a juſt magnifying this great and holy Myſtery. But will any man that is wiſe conclude thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that to be their Judgment, which is now, and hath been ſince their times vainly precended, and thruſt upon them by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> meerly upon the account of their florid Elocutions, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per bolies, and high Expreſſions uſed by them, to quicken Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants to their Duty, when they come to the Lords Table? For our parts, we cannot ſo conclude, for then we ſhould condemn our ſelves, who often do the ſame thing, to the ſame good end and purpoſe, as they did yet abhor this unſcriptural Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</p>
               <p>A Doctrine it is that overthroweth the very nature of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: For unleſs there be an outward ſign really continued in it, ſuch as Chriſt inſtituted to Repreſent and aſſure the Grace he principally intended to the Faith of thoſe that come worthily unto it, it is and muſt be utterly annihilated; Neither can it be ſaid that the Accidents of Bread and Wine do remain as a Sign, when the Subſtance is vaniſhed; For there can be no Reſemblance nor Analogy
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:61822:44"/>between thoſe Accidents which have nothing in them of Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Body and Blood of Chriſt whereby the Souls of True Believers are in and by that Sacrament really nouriſhed and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Nor can it be denied that in every Sacrament, it is meet and requiſite that there be an Analogy or convenient Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the outward Sign, and that ſpiritual good thing which is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by it.

               <p>A Doctrine which, like the Eutichian Hereſie of old, diſanuls the Verity of Chriſts Human Nature; For it hath fancied ſuch a Body unto Chriſt, which in one and the ſame moment of time may be in many thouſands of places, <hi>viz.</hi> wherefoever the Maſſing-Prieſts ſhall pleaſe to Conſecrate their Hoſt, which clearly contradicts not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nature and Reaſon, but the plain word of-Scripture, which ſaith,<note place="margin">

It is the Crucified Body of Chriſt which is Repreſented in the Sacrament, not the Glorified. 3. Chriſt's Body is not, by being Glorified, ſo deveſted of its natural Properties, as to ceaſe from being a Body: and if by being in Glory, it be made ubiquitary (a Property only belonging to the Divine Nature) then ſhall our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be ſo too in Heaven, (which I think no man will ſay) <hi>For theſe Vile Bodies ſhall be made like unto Chriſt's Glorious Body, Phil.</hi> 3.21.</p>
               <p>It would be too great wearineſs to my Reader if I ſhould lead him into a conſideration of the many groſs Abſurdities, which ariſe from this upſtart Doctrine, that which hath been here in ſhort alledged againſt it, is enough to ſhew the Vanity of it. And ſo long as the Abettors thoroof continue in it, all who will be faithful to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and his Church muſt proteſt againſt them.</p>
               <p>But we have (ſay they) the word of Chriſt himſelf for our War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, for hath not he ſaid, <hi>This is my Body?</hi> and may not we, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, ſay as he hath ſaid. <hi>viz,</hi> That it is his Body? Yea and one of them, none of the meaneſt (as I find it reported of him by a late Writer) thus vannteth out his Conſidence, that if God ſhould ask him at the Day of Judgment, why he held ſo, he will boldly ſay <hi>Tu docuiſti,</hi> thou haſt taught me. But is it true, that the Spirit of God hath taught him to ſay ſo? and will he like a dull Schollar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>And is it not (ſay they again) poſſible with God to make good his own word by changing the Subſtance of the Bread into the Subſtance of Chriſts Body, though we ſee it not? Wherein they ſeem to be like the Stoick Philoſophers that were of old, who propoſing things ſtrange and uncouth in foretelling future Events, pleaded for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaying <hi>nihil eſt quod Deus eſſicere non poſſit,</hi> there is nothing which God cannot bring to paſs.

               <p>For us, we will not, we dare not, and God forbid we ever ſhould deny this Attribute of Omnipotency to the great God Creator of Heaven and Earth, he hath himſelf ſpoken it, not once, but twice, <hi>i. e.</hi> not once, but many times, once in the Law and a ſecond time in the Goſpel, without Retractation, That Power belongeth unto him. But to argue <hi>a poſſe ad eſſe</hi> will be acknowledged by all to be very Illogical, and in this caſe it is inconſiſtent with found Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: For we are taught by the Holy Scripture that Gods Will and Power are ever joyned together, only his will makes way for the exerting his Power, his actual Power, I ſay, which is of the ſame Latitude and Extent with his Will. <hi>Our God is in Heaven</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>P.</hi> 115.3.) and doth whatſoever he will, not whatſoever he can do: So <hi>Job, What his Soul deſireth, even that he doth, Job.</hi> 23.13. He can at an Inſtant overturn the whole courſe of Nature, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all things to a <hi>Chaos,</hi> by his abſolute power, or annihilate them, but he doth not, becauſe he will not.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but what Chriſt ſaid is true, and what he ſaid he is able to bring to paſs, for being God equal with the Father, we confeſs with Holy <hi>Job,</hi> he can do all things. But the Queſtion is not of the truth of theſe words, nor of his Power in fulfilling them, but of the Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Chriſt intended thereby that a new Sacrament, ſhould be ordained and continued in his Church, till his fecond Advent, or, becauſe his words being ſpoken in this manner, <hi>(viz. Take eat, this is my Body which is broken for you)</hi> whether his Apoſtles ſhould at that time take that Bread which was then broken with his own Hands in their ſight, and which they did then Eat in his Preſence, whether, I ſay, they ſhould take that Bread for his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61822:45"/>Human Body, <hi>made of a Woman, Gal</hi> 4. which was the next day to be Buffeted, Scourged, Crowned with Thorns, nailed to a Croſs, and pierced to the Heart with a Spear: And this his Body which was preſent with them ſitting at the Table, and ſpeaking theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words ſhould (contrary to his own meaning and Reſolution of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before declared by himſelf in expreſs terms, and contrary to the clear Apprehenſion of his Apoſtles) be free from all this Cruelty and extream hard Uſage.</p>
               <p>A very eaſie Paſſion certainly it muſt needs be which Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, if this be granted, as it muſt if their Doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation be from that inſtant time allowed, being the thing which they contend for: Neither indeed can we ſay, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and truly ſaid, that there was never Sorrow like unto his Sorrow, if he had ſuch a Proxy to ſuffer for him. But without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie Divine Juſtice would not now be ſatisfied with Figures, Shadows, Repreſentations, and Reſemblances, but ſeeing the Body is come, which they did all typiſie, the Body it ſelf muſt be Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, or all mankind muſt periſh for ever.</p>
               <p>This latter part therefore of this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> muſt be caſhiered, and the former retained, <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt intended only by theſe words <hi>(This is my Body)</hi> to ordain a Sacrament in his Church, which ſhould be a ſtanding Memorial and Declaration of his Death (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. ſignifies) till his coming again. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there cannot, or ſhould not at leaſt be any difference between them and us. Well then, if our Saviours intent was by theſe words to inſtitute a Sacrament, will not all men ſay that he uſed a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental kind of Speech to that purpoſe, in his forming of ſuch an Ordinance?</p>
               <p>Hither to have we dealt only with our Romiſh Adverſaries thoſe <hi>Pſendo</hi>-Catholicks about this matter. We ſhould now ſhew the Senſe which Orthodox-Catholicks have rendred of it.</p>
               <p>But firſt becauſe there have been ſome who have joyned with us againſt thoſe our common Adverſaries, that have in their haſte gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuch an interpretation of theſe words, as is inconſiſtent with Truth and Reaſon, leſt their Senſe ſhould be objected againſt us, as if we were wounded with our own Weapons, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſhew in one or two particulars, what is not the Senſe of the Catholick Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor of moſt of the Reformed Churches that harmoniouſly agree with it.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, the miſconſtruction which is made of the excellent Form of ſound Words in our Liturgy, is not the ſenſe of the Church, whoſe Children we are. There it is ſaid, the Body and Blood of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61822:45"/>Chriſt are verily and indeed taken and received by the faithful in the Lords Supper; which is a moſt true ſaying and worthy of all Acceptation. But to infer from thence that there is a areal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Body and Blood of Chriſt in that Bread and Wine, is ſuch an Error, that they who make this Inference, do in Effect paſs over to the Tents of the Romaniſts, or Conſubſtantiate themſelves with the Lutherans in their Heterodox Opinion, which is alſo very abſurd.</p>
               <p>The truth is, thoſe words are not to be underſtood with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Bread and Wine immediately after Conſecration (as our Venerable Mr. <hi>R. Hooker</hi> hath excellently declared his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this point which ſhall be ſhewed at large hereafter) but to the time, in which they that are worthy do really entertain Chriſt, and feed on him in their Hearts, after they have Received. So the words ſpoken to them by the Miniſter, when he gives them the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Conſecrated Bread do plainly ſignifie, which words are theſe, <hi>Take and Eat this, in remembrance that Chriſt died for thee, and feed on him in thy Heart by Faith with Thanksgiving.</hi> And this feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt neceſſarily imply a reall Preſence of Chriſt unto them, not to any other. This miſtake therefore of the premiſed form of ſound words in our Liturgy doth not ſhew the true ſenſe which we are inquiring into.</p>
               <p>Much leſs doth that form of unfound words deviſed in the time of the late unhappy Schiſm and Rebellion among us give any ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction herein. The words which were imperiouſly impoſed in thoſe times upon every Miniſter to uſe, when he gave the Bread of his God, after he had broken it, were theſe, <hi>Take ye, Eat ye, this is the Body of Chriſt, which is broken for you.</hi> But now I appeal to the Conſcience of any man that is able to diſcern in this Caſe, could theſe words be thus ſpoken without aſſuming preſumptuouſly a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which Chriſt had not given? yea could they be ſpoken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great offence to the Communicant? For might not he well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, how can this man give us the Body of Chriſt to eat which hath been in Types and ſhall be really broken for us? And what can he think when he heareth theſe words of the Bread, which he ſeeth with his Eyes, and feeleth with his Fingers Ends, but that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Miniſter is Blind, or that he intends to deceive him, or that he believes as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Bread is vaniſhed, the Accidents of it only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that the Body of Chriſt is really ſubſtantially preſent in it.</p>
               <p>I know well what they will alledge for their Juſtification, <hi>i. e.</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:61822:46"/>ſeeing our Bleſſed Saviour uſed this ſacramental Form of Speech in his firſt Inſtitution, they likewiſe may uſe it in a Conformity to him, when they Adminiſter the ſaid Sacrament: Which is ſomewhat like unto him whom I mentioned before, who will ſay unto God at the day of Judgment. <hi>Tu docuiſti,</hi> thou haſt taught me.</p>
               <p>But they may hear that now which poſſibly they never heard of before, or at leaſt did not well conſider, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe our Saviour, like a King that hath command over his Broad-Seal, to Confirm or alter it, as he pleaſeth, ſpake this word, <hi>(This is my Body)</hi> when he firſt Inſtituted this Sacrament, it will be too bold an Arrogancy for any man ſince, whatſoever he be who pretendeth to be a Subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, to ſay the Bread is the Body of Chriſt, when he Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth it. Sure I am, the great Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not word it in ſo bold a manner as to ſay, <hi>The Cup which we Bleſs is the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> or, <hi>The Bread which we break is the Body of Chriſt,</hi> no, but with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Modeſty worthy of Imitation, only thus, <hi>The Cup of Bleſſing which we Bleſs is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt? And the Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> And this it is like, was the Form which all the Apoſtles uſed in their Miniſtrations of this Nature, for he ſpeaks it here in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; <hi>We, we,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither indeed, is there the ſame Reaſon for us, nor the ſame occaſion before us, to ſpeak theſe words, as there was for Chriſt to ſpeak them. He ſpake them <hi>diſcriminatim,</hi> in a way of forbidding the former Sacrament of the Paſſover to be uſed any more, and appointing this of his laſt Supper in its ſtead (as ſhall appear more at large in the following parts of this Diſcourſe) upon which account it is, that he then ſpake this word ſo expreſly, <hi>(This is my Body)</hi> to the end that his Apoſtles, and after them his whole Church might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his meaning, in aboliſhing the old Sacrament, and ordaining the New.. Which being ſo, doubtleſs we are not to follow his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in ſpeaking the words that he ſpake, which brought on this change.</p>
               <p>And accordingly I knew a man at that time <hi>(Domino teſte non men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior)</hi> who for Conſcience ſake did not uſe that indirect Form when he Adminiſtred that Sacrament, but varied from it uſing the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid words of the Holy Apoſtle, when he gaue tho Bread, <hi>This Bread is the Communion of the Body of Chriſt,</hi> adding thereto the words preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in our Liturgy, <hi>viz. Take and cat this in Remembrance that Chriſt died for thee, &amp;c.</hi> and when he gave the Cup, <hi>This Cup is the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt, Drink this in Remembrance, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For knowing aſſuredly that the real Preſence of Chriſt is not in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61822:46"/>the outward Element, but only in the Hearts of the worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, he durſt, not ſay ſo plainly and ſo punctually, as he was then commanded that the Bread is the Body of Chriſt which is broken for his People.</p>
               <p>A large mention hath been here made of the form that was then commanded to be uſed in Adminiſtring the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; Not as if it were worthy of any Regard, (rather it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be expunged out of the World with an <hi>Anathema</hi> fixed upon it) but that our Enemies may not upbraid us with it, and that the World may take notice how apt thoſe that ſeparate themſelves from the eſtabliſhed Orders of our Church, will, though they be aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated in an Aſſembly as they were in thoſe days at <hi>Weſt minſter,</hi> and applauded by their followers for their Piety and Learning, will be to fall into the worſt of Romiſh Errors, though they will ſeem moſt to proteſt againſt them.</p>
               <p>Having removed the Rubs that lay in our way, we may now go on in a plain Path, which will lead us to hear the Voice of our Lord walking in his Garden which is in his Church, where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly meets his People, and makes his mind known unto them. There it is, where we have learnt the true Senſe of his words in this Myſtery. Let us then hear what the Spirit hath ſaid of it to the Church, which is our Mother, and to her Children, amongſt the reſt to one, who is the meaneſt of Gods poor Servants, who rejoyceth that he hath attained to ſome Underſtanding in this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; And if his particular Judgment which ſhall be added towards the cloſe of this Diſcourſe, be accounted by thoſe who are to judge in ſuch caſes, ſit to be built upon the Foundation, his ſong ſhall ever be <hi>Deo Gloria, mihi venia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſenſe of the Church in general is declared in the twenty eighth Article of her Confeſſion, which is of the Lords Supper, in this manner, The Supper of the Lord is not only a ſign of the Love that Chriſtians ought to have among themſelves one to another, but rather it is a Sacrament of our Redemption by Chriſts Death, inſomuch that to ſuch as worthily and with ſaith receive the ſame, the Bread which we break is partaking of the Body of Chriſt, and likewiſe the Cup of Bleſſing is a partaking of the Blood of Chriſt; The Body of Chriſt is given, and taken, and eaten in the Supper only after an heavenly and ſpiritual Manner, And the mean where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Body of Chriſt is Received and Eaten in the Supper, is Faith.</p>
               <p>This is the Voice of the Turtle which is heard in our Land, the Echo whereof is heard in Heaven, which makes ſweet Muſick in that Celeſtial Symphony.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:61822:47"/>
               <p>The word which our Apoſtle uſeth (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16.) in this caſe is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an Emphatical Word which makes Heaven and Earth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common together; Firſt on Gods part, it is <hi>Communicatio,</hi> for God by his Miniſters (in all ages) Communicates or Diſtributes this ſpiritual Food among his People. 2. On their ſide, it is <hi>Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patio,</hi> when they by Faith take and receive this Food into their Hearts, for then, and not before it turns into Nouriſhment in them, and is digeſted by them.

               <p>Much pains likewiſe have been taken by Orthodox Catholicks to ſmooth the way to a right underſtanding of this great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:<note place="margin">R.

Their Senſe ſhall be ſhortly ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up in that Form of words which is to be ſeen in a late Writer, and is in effect uſed by them all.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> what Body did he mean? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his own natural Body, <hi>which is given for us</hi> (<hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19.) <hi>which is broken for us</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 24.10.) but how can this be? It's impoſſible that Bread, while it is Bread ſhould be Chriſt's Body, or Wine while it is Wine ſhould be his Blood.

               <p>But if Similitudes may be of any force (I ſay not in Argumentation, but Illuſtration) in my Judgment there can be nothing more Pregnant to this purpoſe than a Reſemblance that may be made between our Saviour himſelf, and this his own Holy Ordinance.</p>
               <p>Two Natures, we believe, are perſonally united in Chriſt, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Human; Now as the diſtinct Properties of theſe Natures are by vertue of this Hypoſtatical Union ſometimes applyed and made common to both, yet remain themſelves entire without any Confuſion each with other, or Converſion into one another; in like manner there being in this Ordinance of our Saviour a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Union between the ontward viſible Sign, and the inward and ſpiritual Grace, well may the one be denominated by the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet remain themſelves entirely in their own Nature and Subſtance (as they were before the ſaid Union) without any confuſed mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture one with the other, or any real Converſion into each other.</p>
               <p>So the Soul and Body of Man while they are united, are oft-times put diſtinctly for the whole Perſon of a Man, yet are both bounded within their original Beings.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, this real corporal Converſion of the Bread into the Body of Chriſt, notwithſtanding the Confidence which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Party uſeth by it to bring on their Oral Manducation of Chriſts Body in the Maſs, hath no ſuch Warrant, as they dream of, from theſe words of our Saviour, which they ſo much harp upon.</p>
               <p>For it is well known among the Learned (as my aforeſaid Author obſerveth out of <hi>Cameron</hi> and <hi>Moulin</hi>) that the Hebrew Tongue or Syriack, in which Chriſt ſpake, doth not uſe in this form of Speech any <hi>Copula</hi> of Subject or Predicate, either (is) or (ſignifieth.) But ſometimes, and not always Pronoun, as in thoſe places before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the old Teſtamenr, no (is) nor (was) nor any other Verb is there; But thus, <hi>The ſeven ears of Corn, they ſeven years, the four Beaſts four Kings,</hi> which when they come to be Tranſlated into Greek or Latin, then the <hi>Idiom</hi> of the Language requires it, and ſaith <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is, <hi>e. g. The Rock is Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that they are much miſtaken who to bolſter up their deviſed Tranſubſtantiation place the <hi>Emphaſis</hi> here in this word (Is) which Word probably our Saviour did not ſpeak, when he inſtituted this
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:61822:48"/>Sacrament, though it be, as it muſt be, ſo rendred by the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, according (as it hath been ſaid) to the <hi>Idiome</hi> of the Language in which they wrote.</p>
               <p>Thus in ſhort we ſee the Senſe which hath been wont to be given of theſe words of our Saviour by Pious and Learned Men, and which paſſeth for current among us of all ſorts; To which Senſe I alſo for my part do readily ſubſcribe, though (I do humbly conceive) there is ſomething lacking in it, and ſo not fully comming up to our Saviours meaning, I come therefore now, according to my Promiſe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my particular Judgment of it. My particular, I ſay, becauſe I never heard of it before, nor in all my Reading met with it in any Author elder or later that hath written of this Subject. And it is as followeth.</p>
               <p>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt intending, as it appeareth, to put an end to the old Sacrament of the Paſchal Lamb, for which his Diſciples had been ſo ſollicitous, and to Inſtitute this of his laſt Supper in its ſtead, he therefore, having firſt lifted up his Eyes and Hands to Heaven, that he might in the Name of his Father, Conſecrate the choſen Element of Bread and Wine, ſpeaks to his Diſciples in this manner and form, ſaying, <hi>This is my Body, and this is my Blood, q.d.</hi> you have taken that for my Body hitherto, according to the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> (for indeed Chriſt the Lamb of God was praeſigured thereby) but now <hi>This</hi> ſhall be it hereafter till my Coming again: So placing the <hi>Emphaſis</hi> in the word <hi>(This)</hi> as by way of diſtinction from the former Sacrament, calling it likewiſe his Body in oppoſition to the former ſhadows, not making any other change at all, but only one Sacrament inſtead of another; which (it's true) is generally acknowledged, but the premiſed Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Diſtinction hath not been heeded, as it ought to have been, from whence have ſprung the differences, and hot contentions about the manner of Chriſts Preſence.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles themſelves ſo underſtood it, for they never after were inquiſitive, as they had been, about the Paſſover, but were, no doubt, obedient to the Command of their Lord and Maſter, for he had laid this charge upon them, in theſe words, <hi>Do this in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me,</hi> as much as to ſay, leave the other undone, or, uſe it no more, and let none other uſe it in my Name hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who laboured more abundantly than all the reſt of the Apoſtles, kept himſelf preciſely to this command in his Apoſtolical Office. So he telleth the Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23.) that (ſaith he) which I have received of the Lord (meaning
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61822:48"/>not from <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of Chriſt) have I delivered unto you. Yea the very words of our Saviour himſelf, which he ſpake of the Cup, do ſeem to point out this Senſe unto us, for as he ſaith of that, <hi>This is my Blood</hi> of the New Teſtament, ſo his meaning (very probably) may be of the Bread, <hi>This is my Body</hi> of the New Teſtament, that is, which in the time of the New Teſtament you and all other to the Worlds end ſhall take for my Body, not that which hath been taken for it, under the old. For by theſe words he takes away the firſt Sacrament of the Paſſover (how elſe comes it to be out of date?) And eſtabliſheth this of his laſt Supper: the firſt being an ordinance of the Law to continue during the old Covenant, the ſecond he will have to be an ordinance of the Goſpel, as being more apt to agree with his new Covenant.</p>
               <p>This, this I ſay, is clearly the thing that our Lord intended by uſing this form of Speech when he ordained this new Sacrament in his Church, <hi>viz. This is my Body.</hi> He would that his Apoſtles, and his whole Church after them ſhould take his meaning as ſpoken in this manner, This Emphatically, This Specifically, This Subſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, This, not the former, yet this myſtically, even as the former was, <hi>is my Body,</hi> whereby you ſhall be united together in bortherly Love, your Faith alſo ſhall be Confirmed, and your Souls ſtrengthned and refreſhed unto Life Eternal.</p>
               <p>This appears to me (pardon my Confidence) an unqueſtionable rendring of the ſenſe of theſe words, and a manifeſt clearing of all Difficulties yea and of all Differences too, which have been raiſed about them, if men would but follow the conduct of Truth and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>For let it be conſidered, though we find a diſtinction of Gods Covenants with Mankind, <hi>viz.</hi> the old, and the new, yet I ask Is not the Covenant of Grace the ſame now for Subſtance, which it was from the beginning? Was not the ſame Spirit of Chriſt in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances given unto the Fathers under the Law, which is now given to the faithful under the Goſpel, excepting only in the Accidents and Circumſtances of Effuſion and Manifeſtation? How elſe can Chriſt be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>the ſame yeſterday and to day</hi> (as it is ſaid he is <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8.) <hi>and will be ſo for ever?</hi> Had the Fathers a Saviour and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer exhibited unto them in the Paſchal Lamb, otherwiſe, more than ſymbolically, than we have in the Lords Supper? Did they not all eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat, and did they not all drink the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Drink, the ſame not only with and among themſelves (as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Writers would have it) but the ſame with us Chriſtians alſo? For the Apoſtle addeth, <hi>they drank of that ſpiritual Rock that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61822:49"/>followed them, and that Rock was Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.</p>
               <p>Can any truth revealed in Scripture be more plain than this? <hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt was their Expectation, their Comfort, their Refuge, their Rock in all their Troubles, the Food and Suſtenance of their Souls, the Object of their Faith, even as he is now in this time of the Goſpel to all true Believers? And conſequently that this Senſe which is here rendred of our Lords words is moſt true.</p>
               <p>Well may it therefore be an Amazement unto all men, as it is, God knoweth, unto me that ſuch a pudder hath been made in the World about theſe words of our Saviour, which do, and can ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no more in this caſe unto us, than the Sacramental Form of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting a new Sacrament did neceſſarily require, in <hi>Rome</hi> of the old.</p>
               <p>Let therefore the vain words of Tranſubſtantiation and Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, and the Queſtions <hi>de modo ſine modo</hi> (as they have been well called) of Chriſts Preſence in his Sacrament, about which this gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Generation hath been quarrelling ſo long, be for ever abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, and let us for ſhame content our ſelves, as becometh us, and as the Fathers of old under the Law did with the Overtures of God's love in the Arbitrary Diſpenſations of his Grace (for we never hear of ſuch Annimoſities and uncharitable Differences among them about this matter (as have been among us) and whatſoever is in it which for the preſent ſurpaſſeth our Underſtanding, when we come to ſee God as he is, we ſhall undoubtedly ſee more clearly the ſecret of his Covenant, and have a more perfect knowledge of this Myſtery, than we can now be able to attain unto, or than indeed is fit for us while we are cloathed with Mortality to reach at, much leſs through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand.</p>
               <p>In fine, the Judgment of Venerable Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> concerning this point, way well be accounted a <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> to all ſober men: His words are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The real Preſence of Chriſts moſt Bleſſed Body and Blood is not to be ſought for in the Sacrament, but in the worthy Receiver of the Sacrament. And with this the very order of our Saviour's words agreeth, firſt, <hi>take and Eat,</hi> then, <hi>This is my Body which was broken for you;</hi> firſt, <hi>drink ye all of this,</hi> then followeth, <hi>This is my Blood which was ſhed for you.</hi> I ſee not which way it ſhould be gathered by the words of Chriſt, when and where the Bread is his Body, or the Cup his Blood, but only in the very Heart and Soul of him that receiveth them. As for the Sacraments they really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit, but for ought we can gather out of that which is written of them, they are not really, nor do really contain in themſelves
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61822:49"/>that Grace which with them, or by them it pleaſeth God to be ſtow. If on all ſides it be confeſt that the Grace of Baptiſin is poured into the Soul of man, that by Water we Receive it, although it be neither ſeated in the Water, nor the Water chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into it, what ſhould induce men to think that the Grace of the Euchariſt muſt needs be in the Euchariſt, before it can be in us that Receive it?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Reaſon hereof is, in my Judgment, beyond all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For as in the Sacrament of Baptiſm, all that the Miniſter doth, or can do, is to Baptiſe with water, after he hath with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Prayer and Supplication ſet it apart from other water, it is Chriſt himſelf that Baptiſeth us with the Holy Ghoſt and with Fire. Our Miniſtery is but very Waſh in compariſon of that which Chriſt doth unto us when we are Baptiſed. So in that other Sacrament of the New Teſtament the Prieſt can do nothing but give the outward Elements after he hath by Prayer and reciting the words of Chriſt put a diſtinction between them and other ordinary Bread and Wine; it is Chriſt only who by that means feedeth the Soul of a worthy Communicant with his broken Body, and his Blood poured out for the ſin of the World: only, as unleſs we be Baptiſed with Water, we cannot ordinarily expect to be Baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt, ſo unleſs when we are invited unto the Lords Table we come worthily unto it, and there Take and Receive the Conſecrated Elements at the Hands of the Miniſter, our Souls muſt want that ſpiritual nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment from, and by Chriſt which otherwiſe they might be ſed with and made ſtrong in the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>Which being ſo, as it is a truth not to be denied, what need all thoſe bitter Conflicts that have been and are about this matter? We ſhould rather ſay as that worthy Author had written a little before in the ſame Paragraph. <q>Shall I wiſh (ſaith he) that men would give themſelves more to meditate with ſilence what we have by the Sacrament, and leſs to diſpute of the manner, how? If any man ſuppoſe that this were too great ſtupidity and dulneſs, let us ſee whether the Apoſtles of the Lord themſelves have not done the like. It appeareth by many Examples that they of their own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition were very ſcrupulous and inquiſitive, yea in other caſes of leſs Importance and leſs Difficulty, always apt to move Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; How cometh it to paſs that ſo few words of ſo high a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery being uttered they receive with gladneſs the gift of Chriſt, and make no ſhew of doubt or ſcruple? The Reaſon hereof is not dark to them who have any thing at all obſerved how the Powers of the Mind are wont to ſtir, when that alone which we infinitely
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61822:50"/>long for preſenteth it ſelf above and beſides Expectation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Curious and intricate Speculations do hinder, they abate, they quench ſuch inflamed Motions of Delight and Joy, as divine Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces uſe to raiſe when extraordinarily they are preſent; the mind therefore feeling preſent Joy, is always unwilling to admit any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cogitation; and in that caſe caſteth off thoſe Diſputes, whereunto the intellectual part, at other times eaſily draweth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus he.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly it muſt be granted by all that he was in the right, unles we will be ſtill inquiſitive after that which is infinitely above our reach, and conſequently break into Gods Pavillion, where we ſhall find the dark waters that encompaſs it will inevitably ſwallow us up. Neither will it be the pretended ſuffrage of the Antients that will keep us from ſinking in this bold Preſumption. Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I ſay, for all that our <hi>Pſeudo</hi>-Catholicks of <hi>Rome</hi> have boaſted of the Antient Fathers, as if they were their <hi>Coryphaei</hi> in their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox Opinions which they hold of this holy Sacrament, are but Vanity. And let this Eminent Divine (approved even by them for his great Learning as ſhall here be made manifeſt) be heard ſpeak his Judgment alſo in this particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It appeareth not that of all the Antient Fathers of the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one did ever conceive or imagine other than only a myſtical Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of Chriſts both Body and blood in the Sacrament; Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are their ſpeeches concerning the change of the Elements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, ſuch, that a man can thereby in Conſcience aſſure himſelf it was their meaning to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the World either of a corporal Conſubſtantiation of Chriſt with thoſe ſanctified and bleſſed Elements before we receive them, or of the like Tranſubſtantiation of them into the Body and Blood of Chriſt; Both which to our myſtical Communion with Chriſt are ſo unneceſſary, that the Fathers who plainly hold but this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Communion cannot eaſily be thought to have meant any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther change of Sacramental Elements, than that which the ſame ſpiritual Communion did require them to hold.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Which being ſo, let the impartial Reader judge whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not loſt one of her ſtrongeſt holds, wherein many of her moſt able Champions have thought themſelves to be impregnable.</p>
               <p>It will be no offence, I preſume, to tranſcribe thus largely the words of that Renowned Author. For the plain truth is, we who are Clergy-men are obliged in many Reſpects to be more diligent in peruſing his Works, then, I doubt, we are. But however though
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61822:50"/>we in this Generation ſleight them, they have certainly been of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high account with Learned men, in former times. And which is a thing not common, two Kings there have been in our Land, who for Learning and Piety were ſecond to no Princes in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that did much ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt King <hi>James</hi> of famous Memory gave this Commendation of him, that he had received more ſatisfaction in reading a Leaf on Paragraph in Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> writing of the Sacraments, then he had in reading large Treatiſes of that ſubject written by others though very Learned Men.</p>
               <p>Again, King <hi>Charles</hi> the bleſſed Martyr, the day before his Death gave a charge to one of his Children (the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) which was to be imparted to the reſt, to be very converſant in good Books, and among others he was pleaſed to name Mr. <hi>Hookers Eccleſiaſtical Policy,</hi> which, as he ſaid, would arm them againſt Popery. And well may this be a Reflection upon us all that ſurvive him.</p>
               <p>If a Father when he is ready to dye ſhall thus inſtruct his Children, and ſuch a Father who is <hi>Pater Patriae, Tanti Meriti, Tanti Pectoris, Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti Oris, Tantae Virtutis Pater</hi> (as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>) a Father ſo worthy, ſo Wiſe, ſo well Spoken, ſo Virtuous, ſo Learned a King that was (as it hath been ſaid of him in a publick Phrontiſtery) a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Faith, not only by his Title, but by his Abilities and Writings, a King who underſtood the Proteſtant Religion ſo well that he was able to defend it againſt the whole Conclave of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Hell. And when he knew it ſo throughly, and died ſo Eminently for it, it will concern us to be very wary, how we depart from his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by falling off to the apoſtatical Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But for ſuch as have forgotten their Duty and Reverence to the late King our common Father, and the Pious Advice that he left us, ſuch had need to have a very profound Judgment of their own, to bear them out, but that it is much to be doubted they will not in the end prove to be wiſer than <hi>Dapiel</hi> (as the word of Scripture is) no nor ſo wiſe as our good Father King <hi>Charles</hi> the faithful Martyr, who gave us all good Counſel, if we had the Grace to follow it.</p>
               <p>However if we be willing to be arm'd againſt Popery, let us make uſe of ſuch means which he commended unto us, whereof this is one, <hi>viz.</hi> to be diligent in Reading Mr. <hi>Hookers Eccleſiaſtical Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</hi>

                  <q>When I behold (ſaith he) with mine Eyes ſome ſmall and ſcarce diſcernable Grain or Seed, whereof Nature maketh a Promiſe that a Tree ſhould come, and when afterwards of that Tree any skilful Artificer undertaketh to frame ſome exquiſite and curious Work, I look for the Event. I move no Queſtion about performance either of the one, or of the other: Shall I then ſimply credit Nature in things natural? ſhall I in things artificial rely my ſelf on Art, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offering to make doubt, and in that which is above both Art and Nature refuſe to believe the Author of both, except he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me with his ways, and lay the ſecret of his skill before me?

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Let it therefore be ſufficient for me preſenting my ſelf at the Lords Table, to know what there I receive from him, without ſearching or enquiring of the manner how Chriſt performeth his Promiſe: Let Diſputes and Queſtions, Enemies to Piety, Abatements of true Devotion, and hitherto in this cauſe but over-patiently heard, let them take their reſt, let curious and ſharp-witted men beat their Heads about what Queſtions themſelves will; The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Letter of the word of Chriſt giveth plain ſecurity that theſe Myſteries do, as Nails faſten us to his very Croſs, that by them we may draw out, as touching Eſſicacy, Force and Virtue, even the Blood of his Gored Side, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are things wonderful which he feeleth, great which he ſeeth, and unheard of which he uttereth, whoſe Soul is poſſeſt of this Paſchal Lamb, and made joyful in the ſtrength of this new Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What theſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in themſelves, it skilleth not, it is enough that to me which take them they are the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt: His Promiſe in witneſs hereof ſufficeth, his Words he knoweth which way to accompliſh: Why ſhould any Cogitation poſſeſs the

               <p>Thus ſweetly, thus Chriſtianly, thus Divinely would this Holy and humble Man put a peaceable end to this unhappy Controverſie. A man, I ſay, of whom and of his works, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that then was (<hi>viz. Clement</hi> the Eight) gives this Character, There is no Learning that this man hath not ſearcht into, nothing too hard for his Underſtanding, this man indeed deſerves the name of an Author, his Books will get Reverence by Age, for there is in them ſuch Seeds of Eternity, that if the reſt be like unto this, they ſhall laſt, till the laſt fire ſhall conſume all Learning.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe did that Pope (if my Hiſtorian be of ny Credit) (as I believe he is) declare his Opinion,<note place="margin">Iſaac walker.</note> when he heard one of his Books of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Policy</hi> read before him.</p>
               <p>But now to draw towards a Concluſion, I ſhall only add one ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out of our Martyrologiſt of a certain Diſputation about theſe very words of our Saviour, <hi>viz. This is my Body.</hi> It was really moſt Eminent, the King himſelf that then was, <hi>viz. Henry</hi> the Eight being a chief Diſputant in it, the ſtory (omitting needleſs Circumlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions) is as followeth.</p>
               <p>When a great Aſſembly of the Nobles and other the Chief of the Nation was gathered by expreſs Order and Command from the King from all parts of the Realm, and all the Seats and Places were full of men round about the Scaffold, within a ſhort time a godly Servant of Jeſus Chriſt one <hi>John Lambert</hi> was brought from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with a Guard of armed men, even as a Lamb to fight with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lions, and placed right againſt that where the King's Royal Seat was prepared, ſo that now they tarried but for the King's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>At length the King himſelf did come with a great Guard, and when the King was ſet in his Throne, he beheld <hi>Lambert</hi> with a ſtern Countenance, and turning himſelf to his Counſellors, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth Dr. <hi>Day</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> commanding him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto the People the Cauſe of that preſent Aſſembly and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>After he had made an end of his Oration, the King ſtanding up upon his Feet, leaning upon a Cuſhion of white Cloth of Tiſſue, turning himſelf toward <hi>Lambert</hi> with his Brows bent, as it were threatning ſome terrible thing to him, ſaid theſe words; <hi>Hoe good fellow, what is thy name?</hi> Then the humble Lamb of Chriſt humbly kneeling down, ſaid, my name is <hi>John Nicholſon,</hi> although of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61822:52"/>I be called <hi>Lambert.</hi> What, ſaid the King, have you two names? I would not truſt you having two names although you were my Brother.</p>
               <p>But after many Profaces and much talk had in this manner, the poor man ſhewing the Reaſon how his name came to be changed, the King commanded him to go to the matter and to declare his Mind and Opinion, what he thought as touching the Sacrament of the Altar.</p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Lambert</hi> beginning to ſpeak for himſelf, gave thanks to God in that he had inclined the Heart of the King ſo, as not to diſdain to hear and underſtand the Controverſies of Religion, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> Then the King with an angry Voice interrupting him, I came not hither (ſaith he) to hear mine own Praiſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but brieſly go to the matter without any more Circumſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lambert</hi> being abaſhed at the Kings angry Words, contrary to all mons Expectation, ſtayed a while, conſidering with himſelf what he might do in thoſe great Straits and Extremities. But the King being haſty with Anger and Vehemency ſaid, why ſtandeſt thou ſtill? Anſwer as touching the Sacrament of the Altar, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doſt thou ſay that it is the Body of Chriſt, or wilt deny it? and with that word, the King lifted up his Cap.</p>
               <p>Then ſaith <hi>Lambert,</hi> I anſwer with St <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that it is the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt after a certain manner. Anſwer me (ſaith the King) neither out of St. <hi>Auſtins</hi> nor by the Authority of any other, but teſt me plainly whether thou ſayeſt, it is the Body of Chriſt or no? <hi>Lambert</hi> replyed, I deny it then to be the Body of Chriſt. Mark well (ſaith the King) for now thou ſhalt be condemned even by Chriſt's own Words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum, This is my Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this was finiſhed with great Triumphing amongſt the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, and ſundry other Arguments uſed by them againſt him, all which were common and nothing ſorcible, the King asked him, what ſayeſt thou? Art thou not yet ſatisfied? Wilt thou live or dye? Thou haſt yet free choice. <hi>Lambert</hi> anſwered, I yield and ſubmit my ſelf wholly unto the will of your Majeſty. Then ſaid the King, Commit thy ſelf unto the Hands of God, not unto mine. <hi>Lambert</hi> replyed, I Commend my Soul unto the Hands of God, but my Body I wholly yield and ſubmit unto your Clemency.</p>
               <p>The King replyed very ſmartly upon him, if you do commit your ſelf unto my Judgment, you muſt dye, for I will not be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron unto Hereticks. And thereupon immediately cauſed the Sentence of Condemnation to be read againſt him, which was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:61822:52"/>Executed in a moſt terrible manner with greater Cruelty than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>
               <p>Here, if may be ſaid, was a Bolt ſoon ſhot, which of it ſelf in Reaſon could do no hurt, but being backt with the Venom of Folly and Phrenſie proved deadly. For let all mankind judge, who are able and impartial, was not this a doughty Argument which that King uſed, to drive a poor innocent Lamb to the Slaughter? And will not the very Children of this Generation, that are inſtructed in the knowledge of this Truth, as it is here opened and made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, be amazed and aſhamed to ſee the Holy Scripture ſo groſly abuſed in the maintenance of ſuch a curſed Error?</p>
               <p>Yet was this their <hi>Argumentum Achilleum,</hi> their dead doing Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon in thoſe days of Ignorance and Cruelty, and ſtill is at this very day with our Catholicks (falſly ſo called, unleſs it be that they are of a Catholick Confederacy againſt Chriſt and his Goſpel) which we ſhall certainly find to our ſmart and ſorrow, if ever they come to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over us: For their <hi>hoc eſt Corpus meum</hi> will prove to us to be but as a Preface to their Writ <hi>de Comburendo,</hi> for their mercileſs burning of our Bodies. But bleſſed be God we have hitherto been kept out of their reach: and bleſſed for ever of God be the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which is ſet over us whereby, under God, we are ſtill preſerved.</p>
               <p>Yet neither do we ſleight the words of our Lord, which he ſpake ſaying <hi>(This is my Body)</hi> God forbid that ſuch a Thought ſhould ever enter into our Hearts, no, but taking them in the ſenſe which he intended, they are the Crown of our rejoycing: His Promiſe herein is the greateſt Bleſſing that we can be capable of in this World; It is our Life, and without it we ſhall ever be dead in our Sins and Treſpaſſes; whatſoever ſpiritual Quicknings we have in us to heavenly things, <hi>it is the Body of Chriſt, and the Blood of Chriſt,</hi> which we have Received into our Hearts by Faith that worketh them in us, for we live not (as the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid) but Chriſt liveth in us. <hi>It is the Body of Chriſt, and it is the Blood of Chriſt</hi> which filleth the whole inward man, inlightning the Underſtanding, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the Will, ordering the Affections, putting courage into the Heart to encounter any Difficulties for Chriſt, to ſuffer any Torments for his ſake that can be inflicted upon us by Men or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. Nay more, <hi>It is the Body of Chriſt, and it is the Blood of Chriſt</hi> ſeparated each from other, which were ſo taken and Received in the Lords Supper, and which continue to be ſo in the Hearts of thoſe that worthily Received that Holy Sacrament, which fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth all their Hunger and Thirſt, as bringing a clear Evidence of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:61822:53"/>Chriſts Death, and conſequently a full Aſſurance of the Pardon and Remiſſion of their ſins unto them, the memorial of Chriſts Death being the main end why the Sacrament was ordained.</p>
               <p>This, in ſhort, is that real Preſence of Chriſt in this Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which the Church the Spouſe of Chriſt expecteth, ſo as to be entertained by her Lord at his holy Table, and which indeed is only to be deſired, as being moſt advantageous unto her.</p>
               <p>As for that Preſence of Chriſt in this Sacrament which Papiſts contend for, let it paſs for a Dream, as it is; It ſhall even be (to uſe the words of the Prophet) <hi>As when a hungry man dreameth, and behold he eateth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>but he awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and his Soul is empty; And as when a thirſty man dreameth, and behold he drinketh, but he awaketh, and behold he is faint, and his Soul hath Appetite; So ſhall their hoc eſt Corpus meum,</hi> I mean their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Tranſubſtantiation, of the outward Elements in the Lords Supper into the Body and Blood of Chriſt prove to be unto them but a miſerable Deluſion. Never never O my God let my Soul enter into their Secret, nor be baptiſed with a Baptiſm that they are Baptiſed with. And with this Confidence I do ſhut up this whole Diſcourſe, God Almighty give a Bleſſing unto it.</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>BUt now (it ſeems) to ſtrengthen the Popiſh Intereſt Hell is broke looſe; ſeditious Pamphlets now flutter about for the diſcrediting our Religion and our Church (which hath been acknowledged the beſt Reformed Church in the Chriſtian World) ſuch Pamphlets, I ſay, as are not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctrine of the true Proteſtant Religion, but againſt the beſt Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline alſo, witneſs that ſcandalous and ſcurrilous Piece <hi>(Gratum opus Agricolis Romanis atque Atheiſtis)</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>the Naked Truth,</hi> Second Part, whereas in many parts of it, I ſay not in all, it rather deſerves the Title of impudent Untruth, as ſhall be here made manifeſt paſt all Contradiction.</p>
            <p>The Author thereof whom I care not to know, being he is <hi>Prava Avis in Templis, nigroque ſimillima Spectro,</hi> begins his Epiſtle to the Reader with a colloguing Inſinuation, I had almoſt ſaid with much Craft and Cunning, in this manner; No man does more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence good Biſhops than my ſelf: and why ſo? But becauſe he does, it may be, account himſelf to be one (it is an ill Bird then that will defile his own Neſt) nor (ſaith he) does any man leſs dread them with a ſlaviſh fear. But <hi>non obſtante</hi> all his Confidence, I, who am a poor inconſiderable man, ſhall here take the boldneſs, before I go with him a foot further to expoſtulate with him in this caſe. Who (Sir) is there that doth ſo dread them? I know a man who is in the ſeventy ſeventh year of his Age, and in the fifty third year of his Ordination to the office and order of an Evangelical Prieſt, yet in his full ſtrength (bleſſed be God,) at which Age fears do commonly, as other weakneſſes, take hold of a man, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he hath in his time lived under the Inſpection of many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, yet had he never ſuch a fear of them upon him, nor have I at this day, for the plain truth is, there neither was nor is any the leaſt need of it. Nor is there, I believe any one of our Biſhops who is willing to be ſo dreaded, for if curteous Affability, father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inſtruction, brotherly Condeſcention, tender Compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the weaker ſort, be to be found in them, and that very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently conſtantly upon all emergent Occaſions preſented before
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61822:54"/>them (as I know by experience to be in ſome of them) what do theſe boaſting words ſignifie, but a vain-glorious huſſing? If they be not a moſt unchriſtian Suggeſtion and ſlanderous Suſurration ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make all that followeth in the whole Tract liable to ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among wiſe Men. As indeed many other of his following words do.</p>
            <p>I admire them (ſaith he) at my diſtance (which he preſumeth is not very great) but I do not Idolize them (and God forbid that he or any man elſe ſhould;) I Honour them, but I do not fall down and Worſhip them; as if none could kneel unto them, to crave their Bleſſing, like dutiful Sons of their Grave and Reverend Fathers, and as all good Subjects do to the King, being ſo in Duty bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> can none I ſay, do this, but they muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon make Idols of them and Worſhip them? I can ſay (ſaith he) my Lord, and not add, my God.</p>
            <p>But let me ask again, does any do ſo, or ſay ſo? Sure there is not ſuch a Polytheiſm to be found among us here in this Nation, though there be (God be merciful to us) much Atheiſin, which is like to grow up to a more prodigious Height, than it hath yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, by the means of this and the like prodigious Pamphlets that are ſcattered among us.</p>
            <p>The man goeth on in his Apology thus, You will not find in this enſuing Inquiry the leaſt tang of Bitterneſs or yellow Choler, no not ſo much as one tart or harſh Expreſſion, being ſo far from juſtly diſguſting any, that I ſhall not ſo much as ſet their Teeth on edge, ſo inſipied and ſimple an Humour have I cheriſht all-a-long through this whole Diſcourſe (for fear of any Satyrical Mixtures) that I doubt you will ſcarce find any Salt, Savor or ſmacky Relliſh here, 'twill ſcarce bite the Tongue of a ſinner.</p>
            <p>'Twill indeed ſcarce be believed that a man who writes theſe words ſhould at all prevaricate, I mean, make at firſt ſuch a ſhew of Lenity, and yet ſteep his words after, in the very Gall of Aſps: Nay with what ſerenity of Mind and Conſcience could he make this Apology for himſelf, when his deſign was, it's apparent, to whet his Pen like a Sword, or, ſhould he ſay, it was not his deſign, when his Spirit was ſcrewed up to a Magiſterial Height, he could not contain himſelf but muſt either laſh out into a Phrenſie, or elſe fall into a People-pleaſing Whimſie. Which is the moſt ſordid Deſcent for a man of his meaſures to ſink into: But poſſibly he might ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that thoſe who would undertake to Read him might be blind, or that they would not be able to diſcern his ſhuffling Digloſſia's.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry that a man of his Rank and Reach that he is thought to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61822:54"/>be, ſhould deſerve ſuch terms to be put upon him: But let all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial men that are wiſe and godly judge upon their reading him whether he doth not deſerve it, not only I ſay to be accounted Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, wherein he hath a ſurpaſſing faculty, though he diſclaims it, but to be groſly hypocritical in pretending Smoothneſs and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet proving really, throughout, rugged and Sarcaſtical.</p>
            <p>If this be not <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But Oh no, by no means, his Reader he would have to be <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I ſhall therefore be as long breaſted (to uſe his word) as I can, not intending to trouble my ſelf much with his tedious loquacity; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſingle out two or three of his naked <hi>Pudenda,</hi> to lay them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, which he well deſerveth, to the view of the World, for this very purpoſe (which he cannot diſlike) that the naked Truth may not ſuffer any wrong by them.</p>
            <p>Firſt a great picque he hath againſt our Eccleſiaſtical Courts, as if they were illegal having no Parliamentary Foundation, and their proceedings unjuſt, no good to be done by them without their Fees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will not contend with him about Law-matters, it is out of my Road: He is not for Reformation of them, nor for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification, but for Deſtruction; Deſtruction, Deſtruction is his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſong, down with them, down with them even to the very ground, for it is Money, Money,<note place="margin">A common thing in all Temporal.

            <p>Behold the inſipid and ſimple Humour of the man, which he ſaith he hath cheriſht all-a-long through his whole Diſcourſe for fear of any Satyrical Mixtures.</p>
            <p>But by his leave, they that have an office are to wait upon their office, and is there not Reaſon then they ſhould live by their office? If they live not honeſtly by it, I would they did, wiſhing alſo that ſome legal Courſe might be taken with them to compel them thereto, but muſt the Courts be thereupon utterly diſſolved? That were the next way to bring in all Wickedneſs and Debauchery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Nation, as we have found by ſad Experience already the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61822:55"/>temporary Suſpending of Church-Cenſures hath been, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the proceedings in Temporal Courts, a great Inlet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>If Corruption in Eccleſiaſtical Courts hath made them unfit to be continued, there may be the ſame Plea againſt Temporal Courts; for where is any thing in this World of a Human Alloy, ſuch are all Courts Spiritual and Temporal in ſome Reſpects <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> all of them, which is wholly free from failings? Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Judgment and Perfection in Manners is only to be expected in the Congregation of juſt Men made Perfect.</p>
            <p>The Honourable Houſe of Commons, I am ſure did the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament before this, take notice both of Bribery and Debauchery in the Election of ſome that were to ſit in their Houſe, elſe they would not have made an order among themſelves to prevent ſuch Abuſes, though I hope the major part of them are free from ſuch Corruption; Yea one of them I know, who was then, and is now again choſen for the ſaid purpoſe, is far from the Guilt of ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious a Scandal, being ſought unto by the honeſt People that were to chuſe, who intreated him with much Importunity to give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be their Burgeſs in Parliament, neither would they reſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his Denial till he had accepted of their choice, yea and I my ſelf perſwaded him thereto, telling him, <hi>non nobis ſolum nati ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> the Town likewiſe told him, it ſhould not coſt him a Penny, and and I believe they have made good their word.</p>
            <p>Yet I cannot ſay the like of other places intereſſed in the like Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, having heard otherwiſe of them.</p>
            <p>But if our High and Honourable Court of Parliament cannot be totally free from failings, not only in ſuch Elections, but in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of their Aſſairs, as the World knows they have been in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, who can ſay that Inferior Courts are without any? Yet muſt we not therefore cry, Down with them, down with them.</p>
            <p>O but our Eccleſiaſtical Courts have no Legal Foundation now when the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. is Retracted. And is it ſo? How comes it to paſs then that It is ſtill annexed to our publick Liturgy? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the ſaid Statute were quite Null and Void, it is but a vanity to affix it to our Book of Common-Prayer. And if all Commiſſions granted to Clergy-men be of no force, why are ſome of that Rank and Calling put into Commiſſion for the Peace as men fit for ſuch an Employ as well as any other? yea indeed who are more fit for it than they?</p>
            <p>Again who is there that ſince the Reformation fell under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Cenſures of the Church for Triſſes, as you ſay (but it is a foul
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61822:55"/>Slander.) For it is not to be doubted but that it was for ſome Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Crime, or for their Contumacy and Contempt of the Court, which is accounted an unpardonable Offence in Temporal Courts, puniſhed there with Outlawries and I know not what.</p>
            <p>But what have I done? I have here made mention of Clergy-men; and who alas are they? If we be to be tutor'd by this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> we muſt not word it, as we have been wont, for all Gods People, ſaith he, are his Clergy; And it is certain ſo they are. But as for Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, who have been wont to be called the Clergy, he ſpeaks of them under this notion of Clergy not like an honeſt Clergy-man, but like a mar-prelate indeed with infinite Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, repeating the word ſcoſſingly enough, Clergy, Clergy. But from whence comes all his claſhing like a vaunting Swaſhbuckler a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this word? Why, he will make us believe we have all this while been miſtaken in the word, the word <hi>(Clergy)</hi> is indeed (ſaith he) a Scripture Expreſſion, but never but once found in holy Writ, and then it ſignifies Lay-men, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. <hi>The Flock, not the Shepherds that feed the flock,</hi> the Presbyter <hi>Peter</hi> adviſing his fellow Presbyters, or Prieſts <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>neque ut dominantes cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> not lording it over Gods Lot, over the Flock there called, Clergy-men, that is to ſay, Laymen, thus he.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs this man hath not Read the Holy Scripture with that care as became him, or elſe he hath ſancied all men to have (as his word is) a wide ſwallow, capable of all that he will cram in upon them. Whereas if he had had but Clergy Spectacles with him (ſo he word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it alſo) he would have ſeen his opinion here to be a groſſer Error, even the naked Truth would tell him, the ſaid word is more than once or twice, or thrice ſet down in Scripture, for beſides this of ſit. <hi>Peter</hi> which he quoteth, let him ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.24. <hi>Act</hi> 1.20. <hi>Act.</hi> 8.21. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs he will out of his huge Bounty vouchſafe the favour that the word ſhall be appropriated as it hath been; For thus he writeth: <q>Since this word <hi>Clergy</hi> hath ſo long obtain'd in the World, and alſo is become part of ſome Statutes in <hi>England</hi> (mark that) I will even let it go as it is, and take it in its common Acceptation hereafter; I only have ſaid thus much (true enough) to ſhow that neither the name nor the thing, neither the word <hi>Clergy</hi> nor yet Gods Heritage belongs to this Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> more than to other Chriſtians, if ſo much.</q> Truly (Sir) this Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> is little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to you; Yet the beſt of it is, it is not you that can turn them out of their Inheritance; You have ſeemed to be very friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, and Oh how much Reverence you have for them? But
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61822:56"/>is this your kindneſs to your Friends? Hah? theſe are his own words upon another Account.</p>
            <p>But I will here ſhow his naked Untruth to his ſhame in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. It is not to be denyed, (as it is before ſaid) but that all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whatſoever, that are in Covenant with God, are Gods Clergy, Gods Lot, Gods Inheritance, and bleſſed be God for it, that they are ſo, as all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God were of old called Gods Inheritance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.71. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet was the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> then choſen out in a more peculiar manner, as is evident by ſundry places of Scripture, to be Gods Heritage, his eſpecially <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;c. And for the ſervice which they did at his Altar, he gave them the firſt Fruits the Tithes and Offerings which were his Due:</hi> And can any man think but that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel have as good a Title to theſe Priviledges, as the Levites had under the Law (for even ſo (ſaith the Apoſtle) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. (obſerve) hath the Lord ordained <hi>that they which Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſhould even ſo live of the Goſpel</hi>) upon which accounts, they may well be called Gods Clergy, and the Churches Clergy in a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner than other People may.</p>
            <p>All Gods People were called his Anointed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.15.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. yet were there ſome in publick office among them, who had that Denomination given them <hi>Honor is Gratiâ:</hi> and now are there not Titles common to all the Faithful, which yet are (without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the leaſt ſcruple) aſcribed <hi>Eminemiae Gratiâ</hi> to Eccleſiaſtical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>viz.</hi> Spiritual Men (a term which the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> likewiſe applied to the Preachers of Gods Word in his days <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.7.) Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Churchmen, Miniſters, Prieſts, Diſciples? And amongſt the reſt, this of Clergy men hath been commonly ſo uſed, till this Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor hath deviſed a Cavil againſt it. But,</p>
            <p>Obſervable it is how he is Choakt with the word (Clergy) in his tenth and twelfth Pages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when he can with much facility ſwallow the word (Prieſt) a term more excepted againſt now-a-days, than this, of Clergy. Neither of which (though) can in truth be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cavilled at by him or any man elſe. For the naked Truth is, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Perſons are not uſually called by us (Clergy or Prieſts) with any Reference at all to the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> or to the diſorder of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt (as ſome blaſphemouſly prate) but only in a more excellent way (as is before ſaid) than the community of the People are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſuch ſet apart by God himſelf to preſerve in his Church his publick Worſhip and Honour, to keep a Commemoration of the Sacrifice of the Death of Chriſt, and to offer up Sacrifice of Praiſe and Thankſgiving even for the People when they are ſolemnly Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together in their Congregations.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:61822:56"/>
            <p>Neither will the word (Church) pleaſe him, as it is upon any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergency applied to Clergy-men. But ſo long as the word of our Saviour ſtands in Holy Scripture,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing the offended Brother to make his appeal to the Church, meaning the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> that is the Church-Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or ſeventy Elders, who then ſate by Gods Approbation, to hear harder Cauſes and to decide greater Doubts againſt Peace and Charity. I ſay, ſo long may we call the Aſſembly of Eccleſiaſtical Perſons among us, be they in Convocation, or other Solemn Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or Synods, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> notwithſtanding the Og<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gannition of all gainſayers whatſoever.</p>
            <p>One Inſtance more, he ſaith, he will produce, as if he had not ſaid enough already to his ſhame: He will at laſt ſhew what little Pretence the Clergy hath to Entitle themſelves alone the Church Repreſentative of <hi>England</hi> diſtinct from the Lay-Brethren, and that is in making a Canon to cringe to the Eaſt (thus he wordeth it according to the ſcoſſing Language of turbulent. Schiſmaticks) and to bow at the Name of Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Was there ever any man that made ſuch Pretenſions to truth, and withal did Print and Publiſh ſuch notorious Lies? where doth he, or any elſe during this laſt Century of years (as for what may be done before it is not now material) find ſuch a Canon as he here ſpeaks of, that enjoyneth men to cringe to the Eaſt? Out upon it! This falſe dealing muſt be Repented, if ever he will look for Mercy from Almighty God at the laſt Day.</p>
            <p>True it is, of late, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year 1640, there was a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by the Convocation then, concerning ſome Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies to be obſerved in the Church, which with other Canons was Confirmed and Publiſhed under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> which Declaration, in that part of it which concerns this preſent purpoſe is <hi>verbatim</hi> in this manner.</p>
            <p>Whereas the Church is the Houſe of God, Dedicated to his holy Worſhip, and therefore ought to mind us both of the Greatneſs and Goodneſs of his Divine Majeſty, certain it is that the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment thereof, not only inwardly in our Hearts, but alſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with our Bodies, muſt needs be Pious in it ſelf, profitable unto us, and edifying unto others. We therefore think it very meet and behoveful, and heartily commend it to all good and well affected People, Members of this Church that they be ready to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto the Lord the ſaid acknowledgment, by doing Reverence and Obeiſance, both at their coming in and going out of the ſaid Churches, Chancels or Chappels, according to the moſt antient
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61822:57"/>Cuſtom of the primitive Churches in the pureſt times, and of this Church alſo for many years of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The receiving therefore of this ancient and laudable Cuſtom, we heartily commend to the ſerious Conſideration of all good People, not with any intention to exhibit any Religious Worſhip to the Communion-Table, the Eaſt, or Church, or any thing therein contained in ſo doing, or to perform the ſaid Geſture, in the Celebration of the holy Euchariſt, upon any opinion of a corporal Preſence of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt on the Holy Table, or in the myſtical Elements, but only for the Advancement of Gods Majeſty, and to give him alone that Honour and Glory that is due unto him, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: And in the practiſe or omiſſion of this Rite, we deſire that the Rule of Charity preſcribed by the Apoſtle, may be obſerved, which is, that they which uſe this Rite deſpiſe not them which uſe it not, and that they who uſe it not, condemn not thoſe that uſe it.</p>
            <p>If this be the Canon that the man means, as I believe it is, I do appeal to all men that are able to diſcern between Truth and Error what joſt; exceptions can be taken againſt theſe words; is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that they carry in them a ſound of much Piety towards God, much tenderneſs of Spirit towards the People of God, in perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them with meekneſs of Wiſdom, to conſent unto that pious Courſe there propounded for the advancement of Gods Majeſty? And what can be more Chriſtian like ſpoken than that which is there added in the cloſe, deſiring that the Rule of Charity preſcribed by the Apoſtle may be obſeryed, which is, that they who uſe this Rite, <hi>viz.</hi> of reverential Geſture in the publick Service of God, deſpiſe not them who uſe it not, and that they who uſe it not, condemn not thoſe that uſe it. What impoſing then is here upon People a cringing to the Eaſt? It is not expreſly diſavowed? where is that unlawful Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non which is ſaid to be obtruded upon the Church? Yea where is that Popiſh Superſtition which hath been and ſtill is mouthed out in theſe times againſt Convocations of the Clergy, the Clergy? Where? It will certainly be ſound one day to be in the Pens, in the Tongues, in the Hearts of thoſe that make theſe cauſeleſs, uncharitable inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives; It is not in the Clergy, it is not in their Aſſemblies nor in their Adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>Oh but to the Bowing at the Name of Jeſus he hath ſome what more to object, he will not, he ſaith, let that go ſo: He will ſmite it firſt with his Tongue, rather than confeſs with his Knee, or his Tongue that <hi>Jeſus is The Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what can he or what doth he ſay, but the ſame nauſeous <hi>Crambe</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:61822:57"/>which his old Acquaintance of the Separation have ſaid before him? <hi>Quae omnia protrita &amp; proſtigata ſunt</hi> (as it hath been ſaid by a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man in another caſe like unto this.)</p>
            <p>The Convocation in <hi>Amo</hi> 1603, doth indeed order that when in time of Divine Service the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhall be mentioned, due and lowly Reverence ſhall be done by all Perſons preſent, as it hath been accuſtomed: Teſtifying by theſe outward Ceremonies and Geſtures, their inward Humility, Chriſtian Reſolution, and due acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the True and Eternal Son of God, is the Only Saviour of the World, in whom alone all the Mercies, Graces, and Promiſes of God to mankind for this life, and the life to come are fully and wholly compriſed.</p>
            <p>And is this now to be accounted any ſo great a Crime in that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod to make ſuch a Canon, that they muſt be condemned; as if they were unworthy to be called Gods Clergy? Had they done any thing to the Diſhonour of our Lord, could they have had a heavier Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſt upon them? It is, he ſaith, a Diſhonour to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Holy Ghoſt to Prefer the ſecond Perſon before them, being co-equal in Glory. And therefore may the Lord Jeſus Chriſt account himſelf diſhonoured by this Bowing to him, ſeeing the Father and the Holy Ghoſt have not the ſame Honour done unto them. Theſe are his chief Objections, as for the reſt, they are ſo Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and Prophane that they deſerve not a Refutation, but to theſe I return briefly.</p>

If we did believe that our Lord Jeſus took upon him the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Man, when he was made of a Woman, and that we do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon aſcribe unto him this Honour we ſhould in ſo doing Diſhonour him. For firſt we ſhould deprive him of his higheſt Honour, which is, of being God equal with the Father. 2. We ſhould thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, of which he will never approve, it being of dangerous conſequence to all the three Perſons, it being alſo written that we ſhould honour the Son even as we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Father; Yea then we ſhould believe a Quaternity of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons contrary to that which is Revealed and Believed ever ſince the Goſpel hath been Preached and Written, wherein I conſeſs we ſhould ſin ſadly. But this we do not. That therefore cannot be imparted to us, in this caſe nor in any other.</item>
               <item>2. We do not aſcribe this Honour to Chriſt, as he is the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, the Son of the Father: For then indeed we ſhould be partial in the Worſhipping of our God, preſenting one perſon before another, and conſequently ſhould be guilty of Idolatry in framing an Imagination of our God in our Hearts, otherwiſe than it is written.</item>

            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:61822:58"/>
            <p>But thirdly, this Honour we do aſcribe to Chriſt as he is Mediator between God and us, and no otherwiſe, not exalting him thereby above the firſt and third Perſons, but becauſe we would exalt him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove every Name that is named among all the Creatures of God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven or in Earth, and we believe in ſo doing we do not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</p>
            <p>It will be ſaid, we do give more Honour unto the Name of Jeſus, than we do to the Name of the Father and of the Holy Ghoſt. It muſt be anſwered, <hi>Jeſus</hi> we know is a proper Name given to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our at his Birth, as all we of the ſame nature have, but there are no ſuch Names given to the Father and the Holy Ghoſt; Neither are the three Perſons to be diſtinguiſhed by Names and Titles, but only Relatively. For then we ſhould make ſuch a diſtinction as is inconſiſtent with the Catholick Faith, and therefore, it is groſs Ignorance in this Objector and all his Complices to dream of ſuch a matter.</p>
            <p>But becauſe there ſeems to be a neceſſity that this Myſtery be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, I ſhall therefore endeavour upon this occaſion ſo far as I can be able to reach the Sence of the Spirit of God in it revealed in holy Scripture to open it here more largely.</p>
            <p>It is not to be doubted, there is nothing more intelligible than God, becauſe he is the firſt, the Perfecteſt and Trueſt Being, the firſt mover which ordereth all things, but receiveth no order from any, the pureſt Act, the higheſt ſublimated <hi>Elixir,</hi> the Supream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Entity, the moſt ſovraign and ſimple Eſſence, without any the leaſt imaginary Metaphyſical Compoſition at all; Yet is our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of him (whether we be in the Body, or out of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whether in this Life, or that which is to come) ſo ſhort, and ſo ſhallow of a total Penetration into his Eſſence, that we muſt let that alone for ever:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job</hi> 11.7.8.</note> 
               <hi>Zophar</hi>'s Queſtion to <hi>Job</hi> will put us all to a <hi>Nonplus,</hi> canſt thou by ſearching find out God? Canſt thou find out the Almighty unto Perfection? It is high as Heaven what canſt thou do? Deeper than Hell, what canſt thou know? We read (<hi>Gen.</hi> 32.29.) how God Rebuked <hi>Jacob,</hi> for his inquiring after his name, <hi>Tell me I pray thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thy name, and he ſaid, wherefore is it that thou doeſt ask after my name?</hi> Yet to let him ſee what he was without telling him any name, <hi>He Bleſſed him there.</hi> So when <hi>Manoah, Judg.</hi> 13.16. would be inquiſitive in the like kind he met with the ſame Repulſe, <hi>Why askeſt thou thus after my name, ſeeing it is ſecret or wonderful,</hi> and accordingly he made it known in his wonderful Work which he then wrought.</p>
            <p>And verily to talk much of Gods Name I mean of an appellative,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:61822:58"/>diſtinctive <hi>Notamen</hi> is not, cannot be ſafe, the way of Negation is (indeed) and muſt be accounted the beſt and ſafeſt for us to take in ſpeaking of God, that is, to ſhew not what he is, but what he is not.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.29.</note> After this manner did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old ſpeak of God; <hi>Balaam</hi> the falſe Prophet as well as <hi>Samuel</hi> the true, could ſay God is not a man that he ſhould Lye, nor the Son of Man that he ſhould Repent. It will not become us boldly to gaze upon the glorious Excellency of God, or to break into his Pavillion: rather it is our Duty to ſettle our Thoughts upon thoſe negative Expreſſions of him, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, Inviſible, Infinite, Immenſe, Incorporeal, Unchangeable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whoſoever he be that ſhall preſumptuouſly ask, Who is God, or what is his Name? He may be anſwered, God is not ſuch an one as thy ſelf; But he is ſuch an one as will Reprove thee for thy unreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and raſh Intruſion into the Secret of his Soveraignty. He hath no Compeere either in Nature or in Honour, being <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niſſimus Deus, One alone, and none beſides him, Eſ.</hi> 45.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither hath he any proper name at all, ſuch names being uſed among us for diſtinction ſake, and for the avoiding of Error in miſtaking one for another, which danger is not Incident to the one only True God. 'Tis true we read of names of God in Scripture, but they only ſhew the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Properties of God, being <hi>Numina</hi> rather than <hi>Nomina,</hi> for <hi>Numen Incomprehenſibile eſt Deus</hi> (was the ſaying of old) <hi>ſed omnino abſque nomine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Chriſt hath a proper Name given him, and he is to be known by it unto his Church for ever. Undoubtedly therefore it ought to be uſed with Reverence by all thoſe that receive Comfort and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by the Senſe and ſignificancy of it.</p>
            <p>Which Duty ſhould be done according to the Tenour of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Canon upon theſe two Conſiderations. Firſt becauſe that for our ſakes our Lord Jeſus made himſelf of no Reputation. 2. Becauſe a ſort of wretched men in the World about us, ſet on by the Devil, Conſpire together to make him of no Reputation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
            <p>Firſt for our ſake he made himſelf of no Reputation, great Reaſon therefore that we ſhould account him worthy of all Honour; Not only that which is ſpiritual in captivating every Thought to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of his Goſpel, but that alſo which is of the Body, in the outward Deportment of it (for he hath bought it with a Price, a great Price, even his deareſt Blood, as well as the Soul,) It was no Robbery for him to be equal with God, for he was and is the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Fathers Glory, the Character of his Perſon, yet Saint
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61822:59"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> tells us he emptied himſelf, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of Men, and being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Quanto pro me vilior tanto mihi charior,</hi> ſaid holy <hi>Bernard</hi> ſweetly, the more Humility appeared in him, it is but meet that the more honour be aſcribed unto him. Admit that it be not a duty of the Text to uſe Genu-ſlexions at the mentioning of his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Name, when we are employed in the publick Exerciſes of our Religion, yet ſince the Father hath even upon the account of his Humility, highly exalted him, and given him a name above every Name, it well becometh the Church upon the ſame account (in a Conformity to that divine Pattern) according to her poor ſtrength and ability, by all ways and means to exalt him likewiſe. This then (I conceive) may ſomewhat ſtop the mouth of Contradiction againſt the Religious Canon of our Church, requiring all Perſons to Bow at the Name of Jeſus, for why, ſhe hath learned it of the Father (whoſe Example is without Controverſie in this caſe worthy of Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to exalt him, becauſe for our ſake he made himſelf of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
            <p>Again, is not our Lord now (as it hath been Prophecied of him, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 53.3.) deſpiſed and rejected of men? Do not Jews, Turks and Infidels blaſpheme his worthy Name, by which we are called? Are not Socinians thoſe curſed Hereticks as unwearied now in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt him to lay his honour in the duſt, as the <hi>Arrians</hi> were of old? Is not the Precious Blood of this Immaculate Lamb of God <hi>(ſhed to take away the ſins of the World)</hi> in many places beſlavered with the impious Mouths of execrable Swearers? And are not ſome wretched people riſen up among us in theſe days, who out of a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſerian Pride, pretend that they are as well and as truly God as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, becauſe they have their Being in God, and are partakers of the Divine Nature? What then ſhould the Church do, but out of a deteſtation of theſe horrid Impieties, and out of a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Honour of her Lord give a ſignal Teſtimony of her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in commanding all her faithful Children to bow their Bodies in token of Reverence unto him at the mentioning of his Name in their Solemn Aſſemblies when they are gathered together for the holy Service of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>I have here given my Reader a ſight of ſome of the ugly Errors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that ſcandalous Pamphlet unjuſtly called <hi>Naked Truth,</hi> which but a few days paſt came into my hands: And having perceived that a leading man here in our Countrey hath been ſeduced by it, who hath,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61822:59"/>(as I have heard) ſpoken theſe words, What will Mr. <hi>Lane</hi> ſay to this? Let him try if he can anſwer it. I was willing to ſet Pen to Paper for the Vindication of Truth which hath been miſerably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by this Pretender unto it.</p>
            <p>But having ſince heard alſo from ſome of the Seniors of our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege by <hi>Winton</hi> that one hath already ſet forth an Anſwer unto it, I ſhall forbear any further medling therewith. And though the Author of it calls them Babies and Boobies (ſuch are his immodeſt terms) that will write againſt him, yet I am confident ſuch a work (as it may be managed) will be acceptable to God and all good men.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs I wiſh with all my heart that Abuſes in our Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Courts, thoſe I mean that are not Imaginary but Real (if there be any ſuch) that they may be removed, which I believe the Chief Governours of the ſaid Courts will be heartily willing unto.</p>
